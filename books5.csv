Born on a hardscrabble farm in the Adirondack Mountains in 1879, she was hailed as an important voice in American poetry by 1916 when her first books of verse, Neighbors of Yesterday and Wild Apples were published.She had early success as a model--she was the Harrison Fisher girl of 1903--and later became a journalist for the American Review of Reviews. In 1918, she met John Quinn, patron of the arts, which placed her in the middle of some of the most important literary and artistic movements in the twentieth century. She counted among her friends John Butler and William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Ford Madox Ford, Pablo Picasso, and Constantin Brancusi.

His prose and the worlds he wove from it have captured the hearts and imaginations of millions throughout the world. But the man who brought us Montag the book-burning fireman of Fahrenheit 451, who captured lost summers in Dandelion Wine and the darkening autumnal tones of late boyhood in Something Wicked This Way Comes has always had another mistress: Poetry.

50028,Conversations with Ray Bradbury,Ray Bradbury,"BIOGRAPHY ] LITERARY CRITICISM This collection of interviews captures the imagination of the writer widely regarded as ""the granddaddy of science fiction."" However, Ray Bradbury considers Fahrenheit 451 to be his only science-fiction novel and his others, including The Martian Chronicles, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and The Illustrated Man, to be more fantasy and horror than science fiction.Bradbury, born in 1920, began reading voraciously quite early. He enjoyed the pulp magazine Amazing Stories when it first appeared. He came to maturity just before World War II, when Nazis were firing V-1 and V-2 rockets at Britain, and began writing fiction as the space age was coming to full stride. In addition to having a moon crater named in his honor, he has received science fiction's Nebula Grandmaster Award for his lifetime achievements and in 2000 the National Book Foundation's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.""The writer's vocabulary need not be extensive,"" Bradbury says. ""He shouldn't throw unusual words at the reader, but I do believe in using the right word. The reader should be given something more than the basic meaning by the use of words that are dynamic and colorful, that provide pictures for the reader.""Since 1941, when Super Science Stories bought his first story, Bradbury has written and published hundreds of short stories, as well as novels, essays, dramas, operas, teleplays, poems, and screenplays. His film work in Ireland crafting the screenplay for John Huston's Moby-Dick in 1954 established Bradbury as a fixture in Hollywood. Versions of his works have been shown on all the major networks, and USA Network produced sixty-five of his teleplays for The Ray Bradbury Theater.During his career Bradbury has given more than 300 interviews. The selection included in this volume begins in 1948, spans more than five decades, and charts Bradbury's long creative life.A recent Ph.D. graduate from Florida State University, Steven Aggelis teaches at Tallahassee Community College.",4.34,1578066417,9781578066414,June 4th 2004 by University Press of Mississippi,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348530468l/50028.jpg
50029,Welcome to the Homeland: A Journey to the Rural Heart of America's Conservative Revolution,Brian Mann,"After George Bush's stunning reelection in 2004, newspaper headlines such as Rural Values Proved Pivotal summed up the story, and the outcome left tens of millions of urban Americans baffled and outraged. America's political divide is not between red states and blue states. The divide is between counties in every state in the nation, and this urban--rural schism is the new frontier in America's culture war. For the first time, Welcome to the Homeland explores the radically different culture evolving just over the horizon of our urban beltways, and explains how Homelanders - Mann's name for the nation's fifty million rural whites - have managed to dominate the conservative base of the Republican Party, the Senate, and the Supreme Court, and to use the electoral college, which favors small states, to their advantage. Ultimately, Homelanders are fighting to create a new national culture, one rooted in the traditional values of nineteenth-century America. In a nation that grows more urban and multiracial every year, how did Homelanders seize so much power? In a unique blend of travelogue, political analysis, and family memoir, Mann unveils a grassroots movement that has done the impossible, reversing the urban tide of American politics.",3.27,1586421115,9781586421113,September 22nd 2006 by Steerforth Press (first published August 22nd 2006),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386749191l/50029.jpg
50030,In Search of a Homeland: The Story of the Aeneid,Penelope Lively,"The fall of Troy, the wanderings of Aeneas, the descent into the underworld -- these phrases from Virgil?s seminal story continue to resonate more than 2,000 years after he wrote it, and Penelope Lively retells this timeless tale with pitch-perfect pacing, poignancy, and drama. The story begins with Aeneas escaping from the sacked city of Troy with his son and father and an important task given by his mother, Venus: He must find a new home for his people. Readers accompany him on his adventure and danger awaits him around every corner.

Later, during three years of brutal captivity at the hands of the Japanese, they also demonstrated their ability to survive. Filled with the thoughts and impressions of the women who lived it, ""every page of this history is fascinating"" (The Washington Post). ""We Band of Angels""In the fall of 1941, the Philippines was a gardenia-scented paradise for the American Army and Navy nurses stationed there. War was a distant rumor, life a routine of easy shifts and evenings of dinner and dancing under the stars. On December 8 all that changed, as Japanese bombs rained on American bases in Luzon, and the women's paradise became a fiery hell. Caught in the raging battle, the nurses set up field hospitals in the jungles of Bataan and the tunnels of Corregidor, where they saw the most devastating injuries of war, and suffered the terrors of shells and shrapnel.But the worst was yet to come. As Bataan and Corregidor fell, a few nurses escaped, but most were herded into internment camps enduring three years of fear and starvation.

50052,The Last Picture Show: Artists Using Photography 1960-1982,Douglas Fogle,"Photography has become an increasingly pervasive medium of choice in contemporary art practice and is even employed at times by artists who do not necessarily consider themselves to be photographers. How did this come to be? The Last Picture Show will address the emergence of this phenomenon of artists using photography by tracing the development of conceptual trends in postwar photographic practice from its first glimmerings in the 60s in the work of artists such as Bernd & Hilla Becher, Ed Ruscha and Bruce Nauman, to its rise to art-world prominence in the work of the artists of the late 70s and early 80s including Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince and Cindy Sherman. Intended as a major genealogy of the rise of a still-powerful and evolving photographic practice by artists, the checklist will include a wide array of works examining a range of issues: performativity and photographic practice; portraiture and cultural identity; the formal and social architectonics of the built environment; societal and individual interventions in the landscape; photography's relationship to sculpture and painting; the visual mediation of meaning in popular culture; and the poetic and conceptual investigation of visual non-sequiturs, disjunctions and humorous absurdities.

His father-in-law was kidnapped and marched into the jungle, never to be heard from again, and his mother-in-law spent time in the Hanoi Hilton, but was finally released.In 1977, David and Becki arrived at an isolated jungle post in Bongolo, Gabon, West Africa. Since then, he has performed more than 6,000 operations, at least one-third of which were initially out of his area of expertise and training.This book is not just about surgery, it's about God's ability to enable, guide, protect and teach His children who find themselves in difficult circumstances.

50069,Written on the Body: The Tattoo in European and American History,Jane Caplan,"Despite the social sciences' growing fascination with tattooing--and the immense popularity of tattoos themselves--the practice has not left much of a historical record. And, until very recently, there was no good context for writing a serious history of tattooing in the West. This collection exposes, for the first time, the richness of the tattoo's European and American history from antiquity to the present day. In the process, it rescues tattoos from their stereotypical and sensationalized association with criminality.The tattoo has long hovered in a space between the cosmetic and the punitive. Throughout its history, the status of the tattoo has been complicated by its dual association with slavery and penal practices on the one hand and exotic or forbidden sexuality on the other. The tattoo appears often as an involuntary stigma, sometimes as a self-imposed marker of identity, and occasionally as a beautiful corporal decoration.This volume analyzes the tattoo's fluctuating, often uncomfortable position from multiple angles. Individual chapters explore fascinating segments of its history--from the metaphorical meanings of tattooing in Celtic society to the class-related commodification of the body in Victorian Britain, from tattooed entertainers in Germany to tattooing and piercing as self-expression in the contemporary United States. But they also accumulate to form an expansive, textured view of permanent bodily modification in the West.By combining empirical history, powerful cultural analysis, and a highly readable style, this volume both draws on and propels the ongoing effort to write a meaningful cultural history of the body. The contributors, representing several disciplines, have all conducted extensive original research into the Western tattoo. Together, they have produced an unrivalled account of its history.

50080,"Through the Dark Continent, Vol. 1",Henry M. Stanley,"Perhaps best known as the intrepid adventurer who located the missing explorer David Livingstone in equatorial Africa in 1871, Henry Morton Stanley (1841-1904) played a major role in assembling the fragmented discoveries and uncertain geographical knowledge of central Africa into a coherent picture. He was the first European to explore the Congo River; assisted at the founding of the Congo Free State, and helped pave the way for the opening up of modern Africa.In this classic account of one of his most important expeditions, the venerable Victorian recounts the incredibly difficult and perilous journey during which he explored the great lakes of Central Africa, confirming their size and position, searched for the sources of the Nile, and traced the unknown Congo River from the depths of the continent to the sea. Accompanied by three Englishmen and a crew of Africans, Stanley left Zanzibar in 1874. He traveled to Lake Victoria, which he circumnavigated in his boat, the Lady Alice. Almost immediately, illness, malnutrition and conflicts with native tribes began to decimate his followers. Nevertheless, the explorer pushed on, also circumnavigating Lake Tanganyika, which he determined to be unconnected with the Nile system. Finally in 1876, Stanley was ready to undertake ""the grandest task of all"" ‚Äî exploring the Livingstone (Congo) River. He sailed down the vast waterway to the lake he called Stanley Pool, then on to a series of 32 cataracts he named Livingstone Falls. Unable to go further by boat, Stanley continued overland, reaching the Atlantic Ocean on August 12, 1877. Mishaps, hostile tribes, and disease had killed his three white companions and half the Africans, but Stanley had attained his objective.His tremendous perseverance (his persistence led his men to nickname him Bula Matari ‚Äî ""the rock breaker"") was complemented by Stanley's abilities as a keen observer and accomplished prose stylist. These talents are fully evident in this exciting narrative. It offers not only the action and adventure of a life-and-death struggle to survive in the African wilderness, but detailed descriptions of native peoples, customs, and culture; the flora and fauna of central Africa; and a wealth of geographical, ecological, and other information. Supplemented with 149 black-and-white illustrations and a foldout map, this monumental narrative will be welcomed by anyone interested in the European exploration of central Africa during the nineteenth century, the exploits of one of the great explorers of all time, and a breathtaking story of human endurance and achievement in the face of immense odds.",3.65,0486256677,9780486256672,October 20th 2011 by Dover Publications (first published 1878),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386920568l/50080.jpg
50081,Dark Continent of Our Bodies: Black Feminism and the Politics of Respectability,E. Frances White,"In this provocative book, a black lesbian feminist looks at black feminism‚Äîits roots, its role, and its implications. From Charles Darwin and nineteenth-century racism to black nationalism and the Nation of Islam, from Baptist women's groups to James Baldwin; E. Frances White takes on one institution after another as she re-centers the role of black women in the United States' intellectual heritage. White presents identity politics as a complex activity, with entangled branches of race and gender, of invisibility and voyeurism, of defiance and passivity and conformism.White's powerful introduction draws on oral narratives from her own family history to illuminate the nature of narrative, both what is said and what is left unsaid. She then sets the historical stage with a helpful history of the inception and development of black feminism and a critique of major black feminist writings. In the three chapters that follow, she addresses the obstacles black feminism has already surmounted and must continue to traverse. Confronting what White calls ""the politics of respectability,"" these chapters move the reader from simplistic views of race and gender in the nineteenth century through black nationalism and the radical movements of the sixties, and their relationship to feminist thought, to the linkages between race, gender, and sexuality in the works of such giants as Toni Morrison and James Baldwin. No one who finishes Dark Continent of Our Bodies will look at race and gender in the same way again.",4.13,1566398797,9781566398794,August 31st 2001 by Temple University Press (first published June 1st 2001),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328752933l/50081.jpg
50082,Dark Continents: Psychoanalysis and Colonialism,Ranjana Khanna,"Sigmund Freud infamously referred to women's sexuality as a ‚Äúdark continent‚Äù for psychoanalysis, drawing on colonial explorer Henry Morton Stanley‚Äôs use of the same phrase to refer to Africa. While the problematic universalism of psychoanalysis led theorists to reject its relevance for postcolonial critique, Ranjana Khanna boldly shows howbringing psychoanalysis, colonialism, and women together can become the starting point of a postcolonial feminist theory. Psychoanalysis brings to light, Khanna argues, how nation-statehood for the former colonies of Europe institutes the violence of European imperialist history. Far from rejecting psychoanalysis, Dark Continents reveals its importance as a reading practice that makes visible the psychical strife of colonial andpostcolonial modernity. Assessing the merits of various models of nationalism, psychoanalysis, and colonialism, it refashions colonial melancholy as a transnational feminist ethics.Khanna traces the colonial backgrounds of psychoanalysis from its beginnings in the late nineteenth century up to the present. Illuminating Freud‚Äôs debt to the languages of archaeology and anthropology throughout his career, Khanna describes how Freud altered his theories of the ego as his own political status shifted from Habsburg loyalist to Nazi victim. Dark Continents explores how psychoanalytic theory was taken up in Europe and its colonies in the period of decolonization following World War II, focusing on its use by a range of writers including Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Octave Mannoni, Aim√© and Suzanne C√©saire, Ren√© M√©nil, Frantz Fanon, Albert Memmi, Wulf Sachs, and Ellen Hellman. Given the multiple gendered and colonial contexts of many of these writings, Khanna argues for the necessity of a postcolonial, feminist critique ofdecolonization and postcoloniality.",3.64,0822330679,9780822330677,April 22nd 2003 by Duke University Press Books (first published April 1st 2003),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344683939l/50082.jpg

Asimov was a prodigious correspondent as well as a prolific author. During his professional career he received more than one hundred thousand letters, over ninety thousand of which he answered.For Asimov's younger brother, veteran newspaperman Stanley Asimov, the creation of ""Yours, Isaac Asimov"" was truly a labor of love.

Dr. Janet J. Asimov, a psychiatrist and celebrated fiction writer, has penned this delightful memoir with insight, poignancy, and wit on topics that she and her husband, Isaac Asimov, found especially meaningful over the years. From profound issues such as religion, philosophy, sex, personal identity, and mortality, to lighter subjects such as traveling together, camping, the golden thirties, and the problems and joys of writing, Asimov reveals many new and fascinating details about two engaging and creative people whose greatest creation‚Äîin addition to their writings‚Äîwas the life they made together. Replete with new information about Isaac Asimov and never-before-published excerpts from his witty letters to her, in addition to family photos, this collection of personal reminiscences complements Isaac Asimov‚Äôs highly acclaimed one-volume autobiography, It‚Äôs Been a Good Life, which Janet Asimov edited.

50097,The Long Trip: A Prehistory of Psychedelia,Paul Devereux,"Many people assume that experimentation with hallucinogens began with Timothy Leary and the psychedelic revolution of the fifties and sixties. In fact, as this illuminating study demonstrates, psychedelics have been used by human societies in every part of the world for ritual and spiritual purposes for millennia. As Paul Devereux points out, our modern culture is eccentric in its refusal to integrate the profound experiences offered by these natural substances into our own spiritual life and traditions. Modern Western culture's recent experimentation with psychedelic drugs raised the awareness of archaeologists and anthropologists, leading them to recognize the use of hallucinogens in surviving traditional societies and in the archaeological record. Devereux reveals dramatic new evidence - from linguistics, ethnobotany, biology, and other fields - for the psychedelic experiences of various prehistoric cultures, and ponders the implications and effects of psychedelic revelations on our contemporary worldview, linking them to out-of-body and near death experiencs, shamanic trances, even memory and dreaming.",4.06,0140195408,9780140195408,August 1st 1997 by Penguin Arkana (NY) (first published 1997),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1297069921l/50097.jpg

50115,Stone Age Soundtracks: The Acoustic Archaeology of Ancient Sites,Paul Devereux,"When we walk through ancient monuments, the silence strikes us: we simply cannot imagine what those who lived millennia before would have heard. But, to our Stone Age ancestors, dwelling in a quieter time, sound mattered much more than it does today. They had an acute awareness of rhythm and resonance, sang and played musical instruments, and ascribed magical qualities to many sounds. Exciting research--known as acoustic archaeology--has reconstructed this vanished aspect of long ago, allowing us to ""hear"" it again. Computer modeling and sophisticated equipment have calculated frequencies and timbres, demonstrating that stone-built chambers, sanctuaries, and even caves were deliberately constructed to enhance ritual sounds. This new knowledge both exposes the origins of music and reveals a lost world where echoes were seen as the voices of the spirits. Travel from chambered mounds in Ireland to French and Spanish Paleolithic caves to Mayan temples in Central America, and listen to the past once more.",3.71,184333447X,9781843334477,March 1st 2002 by Vega (first published 2002),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170366890l/50115.jpg

Now noted military historian Michael Lee Lanning shows how U.S. snipers in Vietnam--combining modern technology in weapons, ammunition, and telescopes--used the experience and traditions of centuries of expert shooters to perfect their craft. To provide insight into the use of American snipers in Vietnam, Lanning interviewed men with combat trigger time, as well as their instructors, the founders of the Marine and U.S. Army sniper programs, and the generals to whom they reported. Backed by hard information and firsthand accounts, the author demonstrates how the skills these one-shot killers honed in the jungles of Vietnam provided an indelible legacy that helped save American lives in Grenada, the Gulf War, and Somalia and continues to this day with American troops in Bosnia.",3.62,0804116202,9780804116206,July 29th 1998 by Ballantine Books,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320506182l/50127.jpg

Dougan identifies the great marksmen of each era and explains the circumstances in which their reputations were established.

This novel explores the ingeniousness of people faced with untenable living conditions, unlike anything they have ever had to cope with. A pandemic of plague-like proportions sweeps over the land, killing most of the people it infects; those who survive seem to have a natural immunity. Some of those, however, are not of the most stellar moral fiber and form packs of angry vandals who prey on the other survivors. A few manage to retain their sanity and with clever inventiveness scrabble out the beginnings of new civilizations, much the wiser for the heinous, paralyzing disease. The Survival of the Fittest could be a most appropriate sub-title for this terrifying thriller, the events of which are no longer completely unrealistic.",0.00,1413710034,9781413710038,December 1st 2004 by PublishAmerica (first published 2004),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170366951l/50134.jpg

With prose set in the middle of his mind, he reveals consciousness itself in all its syntactic elaboration, detailing the luminous emptiness of his own paranoiac confusion.

""Big Sur's humane, precise account of the extraordinary ravages of alcohol delirium tremens on Kerouac, a superior novelist who had strength to complete his poetic narrative, a task few scribes so afflicted have accomplished‚Äîothers crack up. Here we meet San Francisco's poets & recognize hero Dean Moriarty ten years after On the Road. Jack Kerouac was a 'writer,' as his great peer W.S.

Tres enigm√°ticos cuentos que transcurren en un ambiente inquietante tocado por una indiscutible aura oriental, en el que la mezcla de cotidianidad e irrealidad alcanza cotas de un lirismo exquisito.

There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape.

50166,Villette,Charlotte Bront√´,"Villette is Charlotte Bront√´'s powerful autobiographical novel of one woman's search for true love, edited with an introduction by Helen M. Cooper in Penguin Classics.With neither friends nor family, Lucy Snowe sets sail from England to find employment in a girls' boarding school in the small town of Villette. There, she struggles to retain her self-possession in the face of unruly pupils, the hostility of headmistress Madame Beck, and her own complex feelings - first for the school's English doctor and then for the dictatorial professor Paul Emanuel. Drawing on her own deeply unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels, Charlotte Bront√´'sautobiographical novel, the last published during her lifetime, is a powerfully moving study of loneliness and isolation, and the pain of unrequited love, narrated by a heroine determined to preserve an independent spirit in the face of adverse circumstances.Helen M. Cooper's new introduction places the novel in the context of Bront√´'s life and career and argues for the importance of the novel as an exploration of imperialism.Charlotte Bront√´ (1816-55), eldest of the Bront√´ sisters, was born in Thornton, West Yorkshire. Jane Eyre was first published in 1847 under the pen-name Currer Bell, and was followed by Shirley (1848) and Vilette (1853). In 1854 Charlotte Bront√´ married her father's curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls. She died during her pregnancy on 31 March 1855 in Haworth, Yorkshire. The Professor was posthumously published in 1857.If you liked Villette, you may enjoy Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford, also available in Penguin Classics.'I am only just returned to a sense of real wonder about me, for I have been reading Villette' George Eliot'Her finest novel'Virginia Woolf",3.77,0140434798,9780140434798,June 24th 2004 by Penguin Books (first published January 1853),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1314039219l/50166.jpg

50182,Conversations with F. Scott Fitzgerald,F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Literary Criticism -- Biography Conversations with F. Scott Fitzgerald assembles over thirty interviews with one of America's greatest novelists, the author of The Great Gatsby and Tender Is the Night.Although most of these are not standard interviews in the modern sense, the quotes from Fitzgerald and the contemporary journalistic reaction to him reveal much about his writing techniques, artistic wisdom, and life. Editors Matthew J. Bruccoli, the foremost Fitzgerald scholar, and Judith S. Baughman have collected the most usable and articulate pieces on Fitzgerald, including a three-part 1922 interview conducted for the St. Paul Daily News.Fitzgerald (1896-1940) died before the authorial interview became a literary subgenre after World War II. Although Fitzgerald enjoyed his celebrity, as is clear in these pieces, he had a poor sense of public relations and provided interviewers with opportunities to trivialize him. As a result, Fitzgerald was often treated condescendingly in the press. Seven of his interviews-five printed before 1924-have flapper in their headlines. In the Jazz Age-a term Fitzgerald coined-he was regarded as a spokesman for rebellious youth, as a playboy, as an authority on sex and marriage, as an expert on Prohibition, and as an immensely popular writer for his work published in the Saturday Evening Post. Yet his literary ambitions were sizable and his impact on American fiction immeasurable.Matthew J. Bruccoli is Jefferies Professor of English at the University of South Carolina. He has written or edited thirty volumes on Fitzgerald, including the standard biography, Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald.Judith S. Baughman, who works in the department of English at the University of South Carolina, has written the F.

50186,Novels and Stories 1920‚Äì1922: This Side of Paradise / Flappers and Philosophers / The Beautiful and Damned / Tales of the Jazz Age,F. Scott Fitzgerald,"At the outset of what he called ‚Äúthe greatest, the gaudiest spree in history,‚Äù F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote the works that brought him instant fame, mastering the glittering aphoristic prose and keen social observation that would distinguish all his writing. Celebrating the riotous energy and na√Øve optimism of a generation that believed itself liberated from the past, Fitzgerald‚Äôs early works, which are collected in this Library of America volume, also sound a plaintive strain beneath the era‚Äôs wild cacophony, a lament for the wasted potential of youth. They remain the fullest literary expression of one of the most fascinating eras in American life.This Side of Paradise (1920) gave Fitzgerald the early success that defined and haunted him for the rest of his career. Offering in its Princeton chapters the most enduring portrait of college life in American literature, this lyrical novel records the ardent and often confused longings of its hero‚Äôs struggles to find love and to formulate a philosophy of life.Flappers and Philosophers (1920), a collection of accomplished short stories, includes such classics as ‚ÄúDalyrimple Goes Wrong,‚Äù ‚ÄúBernice Bobs Her Hair,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Ice Palace.‚ÄùFitzgerald continues his dissection of a self-destructive era in his second novel, The Beautiful and Damned (1922), as the self-styled aristocrat Anthony Patch and his beautiful wife, Gloria, are cut off from an inheritance and forced to endure the excruciating dwindling of their fortune. Here New York City, playground for the pleasure-loving Patches and brutal mirror of their dissipation, is portrayed more vividly than anywhere else in Fitzgerald‚Äôs work.Tales of the Jazz Age (1922), his second collection of stories, includes the novella ‚ÄúMay Day,‚Äù featuring interlocking tales of debutantes, soldiers, and socialists brought together in the uncertain aftermath of World War I, and ‚ÄúA Diamond as Big as the Ritz,‚Äù a fable in which the excesses of the Jazz Age take the hallucinatory form of a palace of unfathomable opulence hidden deep in the Montana Rockies.",4.28,1883011841,9781883011840,August 28th 2000 by Library of America (first published 1922),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374684538l/50186.jpg

50194,Tender Is the Night,F. Scott Fitzgerald,"F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in a friend's copy of Tender Is the Night, ""If you liked The Great Gatsby, for God's sake read this. Gatsby was a tour de force but this is a confession of faith."" Set in the South of France in the decade after World War I, Tender Is the Night is the story of a brilliant and magnetic psychiatrist named Dick Diver; the bewitching, wealthy, and dangerously unstable mental patient, Nicole, who becomes his wife; and the beautiful, harrowing ten-year pas de deux they act out along the border between sanity and madness.  In Tender Is the Night, Fitzgerald deliberately set out to write the most ambitious and far-reaching novel of his career, experimenting radically with narrative conventions of chronology and point of view and drawing on early breakthroughs in psychiatry to enrich his account of the makeup and breakdown of character and culture.  Tender Is the Night is also the most intensely, even painfully, autobiographical of Fitzgerald's novels; it smolders with a dark, bitter vitality because it is so utterly true. This account of a caring man who disintegrates under the twin strains of his wife's derangement and a lifestyle that gnaws away at his sense of moral values offers an authorial cri de coeur, while Dick Diver's downward spiral into alcoholic dissolution is an eerie portent of Fitzgerald's own fate.  F. Scott Fitzgerald literally put his soul into Tender Is the Night, and the novel's lack of commercial success upon its initial publication in 1934 shattered him. He would die six years later without having published another novel, and without knowing that Tender Is the Night would come to be seen as perhaps its author's most poignant masterpiece. In Mabel Dodge Luhan's words, it raised him to the heights of ""a modern Orpheus.""",3.80,0684830507,9780684830506,1996 by Scribner (first published April 1934),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410170325l/50194.jpg
50197,The Bront√´s: Charlotte and Emily,Laura Hinkley,"From the book-jacket:This penetrating study of the ever fascinating Bront√´s follows the vital connective thread between their life and work, and from one work to another, more closely and more surely than has hitherto been attempted. With sound scholarship and rare sensitivity, the author traces definitely and in detail the steps by which the experience of the strange, moor-born sisters was transmuted into their poems and novels.The early days at Haworth Parsonage when the children absorbed the moors, had their first encounter with death, and lived in a half-world of legend of their own invention, throw much light on their subsequent development. From these beginnings the reader follows the internal growth as well as the external careers of each of the four Bront√´s; the gentle Anne, the dissolute Branwell, lost in a long courtship of death, the practical Charlotte, who alone came to terms with life, and the Gothic Emily who translated her lonely experience to an unearthly plane.In the final section of the book each of the novels of the two most famous of the sisters is analyzed in detail, with diagrams charting the sources from which a single character is drawn.The result is a brilliantly executed journey into the lives and minds of Charlotte and Emily that explores the very processes of genius which produced in one case Jane Eyre, that proud, unhesitating assertion of women's feelings for man, and in the other, the ageless fire of Wuthering Heights.Laura L Hinckley, who lives in California, was a teacher before she became a writer. Her stories and articles have appeared in leading magazines and she has had a play on Broadway. Enthralled by the Bront√´s since childhood, her serious biographical interest dates back some fourteen years. Charlotte and Emily is the fruit of long, conscientious research and mature critical judgment.",3.83,0897603605,9780897603607,June 28th 1981 by Telegraph Books (first published January 1st 1945),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1424620698l/50197.jpg

50200,The Professor,Charlotte Bront√´,"The Professor (1857) is English writer Charlotte Bront√´'s first novel. Rejected by several publishing houses, Bront√´ shelved the novel in order to write her masterpiece Jane Eyre (1847). After her death, The Professor was edited by Bront√´'s widower, Arthur Bell Nichols, who saw that the novel was published posthumously. Based on Bront√´'s experience as a student and teacher in Brussels--which similarly inspired her novel Villette--The Professor is an underappreciated early work from one of English literature's most important writers.After rejecting a life as a clergyman, William Crimsworth goes to work as a clerk for his brother Edward, a successful businessman. Although he excels, his brother grows jealous of his ability and intelligence, abusing and belittling him until he is forced to quit. Disappointed, he accepts a job at a boarding school in Belgium where, mentored by the kind Monsieur Pelet, William flourishes as a professor. When news of his work reaches Mademoiselle Reuter, a local headmistress at a school for girls, she offers him a position, and William joins her staff. He begins to grow suspicious, however, when he overhears Reuter speaking about him with Pelet and discovers that the pair are engaged to be married.

The first provides three overall interpretations of the novel that are excellent examples of the most common approach to Jane Eyre: a reading that explores the psychological development of the novel's eponymous heroine. The second section will introduce more novel approaches: a feminist reading of the novel, a depiction of the psyche in Jane Eyre, a depiction of Jane in light of mid-Victorian discussions of Evangelicism, an analysis of Jane in relation to contemporary debates about the governess, and an examination of the novel in relation to colonialist discourse.

Charlotte BrontÔøΩ was no 'other Victorian' living out a secret life in a sexual underworld, but she did centre her life's work on exploring the complexities of our sexual nature. John Maynard shows how BrontÔøΩ's early stories and novelettes, written from her teens to young maturity for a private audience of her sisters and brother, deal openly with a 'world below' of consuming passion, adultery, seduction, promiscuity, frigidity and incest. He traces how these themes are incorporated into BrontÔøΩ's mature published work, where her psychological insight into the complexities of sexual need finds its consummate expression. BrontÔøΩ's mature novels, especially Jane Eyre and Villette offer an intensely felt but finely realised vision of sexual awakening. They are however, deeply aware of the difficulties that beset sexual experience. Unlike a number of studies, this book stresses the insight, achievement and artistic mastery of Charlotte BrontÔøΩ, who still challenges us to comprehend the subtleties and complexities of her impressively articulated discourse on sexuality.",4.00,0521261813,9780521261814,September 28th 1984 by Cambridge University Press (first published 1984),https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/blank-133x176-8b769f39ba6687a82d2eef30bdf46977.jpg

50275,Last Exit to Brooklyn,Hubert Selby Jr.,"Few novels have caused as much debate as Hubert Selby Jr.'s notorious masterpiece, Last Exit to Brooklyn, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Irvine Welsh, author of Trainspotting.Described by various reviewers as hellish and obscene, Last Exit to Brooklyn tells the stories of New Yorkers who at every turn confront the worst excesses in human nature. Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations. Last Exit to Brooklyn was banned by British courts in 1967, a decision that was reversed the following year with the help of a number of writers and critics including Anthony Burgess and Frank Kermode.Hubert Selby, Jr. (1928-2004) was born in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: 'I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.' In 1964 he completed his first book, Last Exit to Brooklyn, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include The Room, The Demon, Requiem for a Dream, The Willow Tree and Waiting Period. In 2000, Requiem for a Dream was adapted into a film starring Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, and directed by Darren Aronofsky.'Last Exit to Brooklyn will explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America, and still be eagerly read in 100 years'Allen Ginsberg'An urgent tickertape from hell'Spectator",3.88,0747549923,9780747549925,2000 by Marion Boyars (first published 1964),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362815242l/50275.jpg

50278,Classic Tales and Fables for Children,Leo Tolstoy,"Renowned Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy had an abiding interest in children and in children's literature. At the age of twenty-one, he started a school for peasant children on his family's estate, and after returning from a stint in the military, he founded another, experimental school with the motto, ""Come when you like, leave when you like.""Fascinated by the simple charm and the fresh innocence with which the children of his schools told stories, several years later, when Tolstoy began writing about his own childhood, he emulated the uncomplicated narrative style and disarming directness of the tales told by the children of his acquaintance. After completing War and Peace, he incorporated these stories in a series of easy readers, and continued to work on them even while writing Anna Karenina. Known as The ABC Book (Azbuka) and subsequently The New ABC Book (Novy Azbuka), these marvelous readers were widely adopted in Russia and were still in use in the Soviet era.The tales and fables in this volume come mainly from these two well-loved primers. Part I consists of stories about his own childhood, all told with beautiful simplicity. Part II contains Tolstoy's free adaptations of fables from Aesop and from Hindu tradition. Part III is devoted solely to his longest and most famous children's work, the fairy tale ""Ivan the Fool and His Two Brothers.""Never patronizing and often humorous, these small gems reveal Tolstoy's deep appreciation for and understanding of children's artistic and moral sensibilities.",3.78,1573929395,9781573929394,November 1st 2001 by Prometheus Books (first published 1905),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389768113l/50278.jpg

50296,What Does God Look Like in an Expanding Universe?,Jim Schenk,"If you are amazed by the present understandings of the Universe, (12 billion light years across, billions of galaxies each with billions of stars, with its quantum theories and string theories) you will find this new book, What Does God Look Like In an Expanding Universe, amazing as well. Jim Schenk invited theologians, scientists, artists, poets, and thinkers of all walks of life to share their thoughts on Where Did We Come From , Why Are We Here , and What Happens After Death based on the new cosmology. This is a thought-provoking book, of mostly original works, with new images and thoughts about these age-old questions.At a time when the old religious myths are leading us to war, speaking of Armageddon, and saying almost nothing about the destruction of the planet, this book is refreshing. It sees humans as a species of this Earth, a planet that is but a speck in the Milky Way Galaxy, which is one of billions of Galaxies in Universe. In this context, writers in this anthology grapple with the notion of how amazing God must be, the meaning of life, and what happens after death.Schenk says, This book is looking at new metaphors and images coming from the new cosmology that has changed so rapidly over the past 50 years. The images of God, life and afterlife from the old cosmology are so detrimental to our planet, that new metaphors are essential for the survival of our planet, our human species, and the many other species that share this home with us. This book comes out of Schenk s theological background, combined with his deep love and connection to Earth. The significance of this book is its ability to connect us to the Universe, Galaxy and planet of which we are a part, and it allows us to see God, life and death in this unifying context. It excites our imagination, challenges us to think deeper.With prose, poetry, and art, this book opens up an array of ways of looking at God, at Life and at Death that helps us make sense of our lives, now, in this expanding Universe.",4.40,0615130798,9780615130798,December 31st 2006 by Not Avail (first published December 1st 2006),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170368301l/50296.jpg

50301,"The Expanding Universe: Astronomy's 'Great Debate', 1900-1931",Robert W. Smith,"In the years between 1900 and 1931 astronomers witnessed three startling changes in their view of the Universe.

50316,Collected Poems 1947-1997,Allen Ginsberg,"Here, for the first time, is a volume that gathers the published verse of Allen Ginsberg in its entirety, a half century of brilliant work from one of America's great poets. The chief figure among the Beats, Ginsberg changed the course of American poetry, liberating it from closed academic forms with the creation of open, vocal, spontaneous, and energetic postmodern verse in the tradition of Walt Whitman, Guillaume Apollinaire, Hart Crane, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams. Ginsberg's classics Howl, Reality Sandwiches, Kaddish, Planet News, and The Fall of America led American (and international) poetry toward uncensored vernacular, explicit candor, the ecstatic, the rhapsodic, and the sincere‚Äîall leavened by an attractive and pervasive streak of common sense. Ginsberg's raw tones and attitudes of spiritual liberation also helped catalyze a psychological revolution that has become a permanent part of our cultural heritage, profoundly influencing not only poetry and popular song and speech, but also our view of the world.The uninterrupted energy of Ginsberg's remarkable career is clearly revealed in this collection. Seen in order of composition, the poems reflect on one another; they are not only works but also a work. Included here are all the poems from the earlier volume Collected Poems 1947-1980, and from Ginsberg's subsequent and final three books of new poetry: White Shroud, Cosmopolitan Greetings, and Death & Fame. Enriching this book are illustrations by Ginsberg's artist friends; unusual and illuminating notes to the poems, inimitably prepared by the poet himself; extensive indexes; as well as prefaces and various other materials that accompanied the original publications.",4.34,0061139742,9780061139741,October 17th 2006 by Harper (first published January 1st 2006),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389836837l/50316.jpg

50336,Lefts Dirty Job,W. Rand Smith,"As today's headlines make clear, corporate ""downsizing"" is only one aspect of a global transformation challenging firms and governments alike. W. Rand Smith examines a central question in this process: what choices exist for governments of industrialized democracies as they seek to help older, core industries adjust to changes in demand, technology, and new sources of competition? This question is especially important for governments dominated by leftist political parties, which are torn between their commitment to social solidarity and the capitalist imperative of efficiency.The Left's Dirty Job compares recent socialist governments in France and Spain, which because of their longevity and initial reform aspirations, provide a key test of whether a distinctive leftist approach to industrial restructuring is possible. This study argues that, in fact, both governments' policies converged with those other European governments in ""market-adapting"" measures that eliminated thousands of jobs while providing income support for displaced workers. Despite broadly similar policies, however, the restructuring process differed in three important aspects: trajectory, dynamics, and impact.Smith traces this pattern of convergence and difference, and focuses on the internal politics of the governing coalitions of Socialist parties and labour union allies, arguing that these respective coalitions decisively affected their government's restructuring strategies. Featuring extensive field work and interviews with over one hundred political, labour, and business leaders, this is the first systematic comparison of these important Socialist governments.",0.00,0802082319,9780802082312,June 30th 1998 by University of Toronto Press (first published June 1st 1998),https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/blank-133x176-8b769f39ba6687a82d2eef30bdf46977.jpg

As no one has done before, Patterson reveals how the complex interplay between Christian sacrificial symbolism and the deep recesses of post-bellum Southern culture resulted in some of the most shameful, barbaric events in American history.The third essay brings us into the late twentieth century, with an investigation of the various images of Afro-American men portrayed by the media. From the demigod (Michael Jordan) to the demon (Colin Ferguson) to the demigod-turned-demon (O. J. Simpson) and the crossers of racial and gender boundaries (Michael Jackson and Dennis Rodman)‚Äîall contribute to the cultural complications of our contemporary society.Rituals of Blood advances Patterson's new model of ethnic relations that opens American society to a new and freer dialogue.",3.61,158243039X,9781582430393,December 10th 1999 by Civitas Books (first published 1998),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347332946l/50359.jpg

50362,"Dor√©'s Illustrations for Ariosto's ""Orlando Furioso"": A Selection of 208 Illustrations",Gustave Dor√©,"Gustave Dor√© (1832‚Äì1883) was the greatest illustrator of 19th-century France and the leading book illustrator of his day. His startling conceptions and brooding surreal imagery lent overwhelming power to his often definitive illustrations of the classics: The Divine Comedy, Gargantua, and Pantagruel, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and the Bible, among others. In 1879, having produced over 90 illustrated books, he published the last major work of his illustrious career: 618 illustrations for Ludovico Ariosto's magnificent epic poem, Orlando Furioso. Little known today, the work contains some of Dor√©'s finest illustrations.Ariosto's poem combines medieval legends of King Arthur and Charlemagne in a long, complex narrative involving scores of characters, numerous interweaving subplots, and many interpolated tales. The conflict of Christian versus Moor provides the epic background of the work.The present volume contains 208 of Dor√©'s finest illustrations for the poem, painstakingly reproduced from a beautifully printed 19th-century German edition. Included are all 81 full-page plates, the large frontispiece, many other illustrations that fill an entire Dover page, and a generous sampling of smaller, chiefly zinc-engraved plates. The latter consist of many lively and felicitous drawings reproduced directly from Dor√©'s originals without the intermediate service of his team of wood engravers.Ariosto's extended saga provided an almost endless succession of characters, creatures, and events upon which Dor√© lavished the skill and experience of a lifetime. The illustrations range from brilliant quick sketches to highly finished and shaded studies, many of which convey and incomparable feeling of metaphysical gloom. Desolate landscapes, ghostly castles, and titanic battles furnish darkly romantic settings in which tiny human figures often appear overwhelmed ‚Äî helpless pawns of destiny. Against this stark backdrop, a panorama of jousting knights, damsels in distress, heroic deeds, romantic interludes, and mystical events comes to life under Dor√©'s exuberant pen style. His haunting interpretations, suffused with a shadowy mysticism, seem the perfect visual expression of Ariosto's monumental historico mythological tableau.For this edition, Stanley Appelbaum has selected illustrations and provided captions describing the scene depicted, with appropriate canto and stanza numbers. He has also provided an informative introduction and plot summary. Anyone interested in the special artistic magic that results from the fusion of great art and great literature will want to add this inexpensive reprint of one of Dor√©'s finest achievements to their bookshelves.",4.51,048623973X,9780486239736,April 1st 1980 by Dover Publications,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1379899537l/50362.jpg

What could be more remote from the uneventful securities of life in the midland counties of England?

While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.Executed with high-spirited gusto, Northanger Abbey is a lighthearted, yet unsentimental commentary on love and marriage.",3.84,1593082649,9781593082642,March 3rd 2005 by Barnes & Noble Classics (first published December 1817),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388201718l/50398.jpg

50400,Northanger Abbey,Jane Austen,"Northanger Abbey is the earliest of Jane Austen's great comedies of female enlightenment and combines literary burlesque - making fun of the excesses of the Gothic novel - with larger moral, philosophical, and social issues: the folly of letting literature get in the way of life, the inexcusability of not thinking for oneself, and the painful difficulties (especially for women) involved in growing up. Lady Susan and The Watsons are early compositions that reflect many of the qualities of Northanger Abbey. The first is an epistolary novel centring on the intrigues of the villainous Lady Susan; the second is an unfinished example of Jane Austen's most characteristic form - a story where the heroine is outstanding for her sense and goodness, virtues notably lacking in the other characters, who are here part of an altogether bleaker vision.

This volume includes essays by leading scholars on contemporary approaches to understanding war and peace.

Several authors discuss realist theories of war, which focus on the distribution of power and the potential for offensive war. Others examine the prominent hypothesis that the spread of democracy will usher in an era of peace. In light of the apparent increase in nationalism and ethnic conflict, several authors present hypotheses on how nationalism causes war and how such wars can be controlled. Contributors also engage in a vigorous debate on whether international institutions can promote peace.

However, much of the criticism dealing with his work is prompted by his own theories of ÔøΩexhaustionÔøΩ and subsequent ÔøΩreplenishment, ÔøΩ leaving his writing relatively untouched by theories of postmodernism in general. This book changes that by focusing on the relationship between Barth's aesthetic and the ideology critique of the historical avant-gardes, which were the first to mobilize art against itself and its institutional practices and demands. Examining Barth's metafictional parodies in the light of theories of space and subjectivity, Clavier engages the question of ideology critique in postmodernism by offering the montage as a possible model for understanding Barth's fiction.

50419,John Barth and the Anxiety of Continuance,Patricia Tobin,"During the sixties and seventies, the fictional reinventions of john Barth, along with his misread and influential essay 'The Literature of Exhaustion, established the comic novelist as a leading practitioner and theorist of what was then coming to be called postmodern literature. In more recent years, however, Barth's reputation has been called into question within the ongoing critical debate over the criterion of originality and the status of literary repetition, imitation, and parody. In her spirited defense of Barth, Patricia Tobin employs Harold Bloom's theory of belatedness to confront and explode this issue.For Bloom, the later the artist the greater the burden of the past against which he must rebel and the more hopeless his task. However, Tobin argues Barth revels in his belatedness and celebrates the opportunity to survey a rich literary past and to bring back to life its dead forms, genres, and styles by completing, fulfilling, and exhausting them. Not a retrospective and negative anxiety of influence, then, but a wholly prospective and positive anxiety of continuance has propelled Barth through a distinguished career.Throughout, Tobin elaborates the conjunctions and disjunctions between Bloom and Barth with surprising results. Most notable, perhaps, is her examination of how Bloom's model of a map of misreading helps to elucidate, and even predict, the ways in which Barth sets each new novel in antithetical relation to the one before. Along the way, much is said about modernism and postmodernism, repetition and difference, and what it means poetically and willfully to intend a career. John Barth and the Anxiety of Continuance will be of interest to scholars of American fiction and critical theory.",4.00,0812230930,9780812230932,December 29th 1992 by University of Pennsylvania Press Anniversary Collection (first published 1992),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493823611l/50419.jpg

This new, expanded edition, with a fresh new design and new photographs throughout, preserves the best features of the original classic while bringing the book fully up-to-date. The result: the ultimate training manual for a new generation of dog owners - and, of course, for their canine best friends. The Monks of New Skete have achieved international renown as breeders of German shepherds and as outstanding trainers of dogs of all breeds.

How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend covers virtually every aspect of living with and caring for your dog, including: Selecting a dog (what breed? male? female? puppy or older dog?) to fit your lifestyle Where to get - and where not to get - a dog Reading a pedigree Training your dog or puppy - when, where, and how The proper use of praise and discipline Feeding, grooming, and ensuring your dog's physical fitness Recognizing and correcting canine behavioral problems The particular challenges of raising a dog where you live - in the city, country, or suburb The proper techniques for complete care of your pet at every stage of his or her life In this new edition, How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend has been expanded to encompass the latest equipment (e.g., retractable leashes, ""invisible"" fences); new trends in training and care (doggy day care, professional dog walkers, etc.); and dozens of new anecdotes and case studies, drawn from the monks' own experience, that bring to life the essential training concepts. In its scope, its clarity, and its authority, How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend remains unrivaled as a basic training guide for dog owners.

Chapter One, ""Placing Bukowski,"" introduces Bukowski's amazing life and career and relates his work to influential predecessors (primarily Ernest Hemingway and John Fante) and four contemporaries (Raymond Carver, Kurt Vonnegut, Frederick Exley, and Hunter Thompson). Chapter Two, ""Bukowski Among the Autobiographers,"" pursues Bukowski's comprehensive autobiographical project. Harnessing Timothy Dow Adams' concept of ""strategic lying,"" the chapter follows Bukowski's thinly veiled personae through three stages-first through the attention-getting ""Dirty Old Man,"" then responding to the attention and (re)defining himself, finally culminating in ""Henry Chinaski,"" the hero of Bukowski's five autobiographical novels. Chapter Three, ""Problems of Masculinity: At 'Home, ' at Work, at Play,"" tackles the knee-jerk assessment of Bukowski as just a sexist ""Dirty Old Man."" Michael Kaufman's ""triad of men's violence"" (against women, other men, and themselves) explains the general Bukowski persona as a complicated gender construct. Bukowski's Bildungsroman, Ham on Rye, shows Chinaski as victim, practitioner, and critic of male violence, with the last role figuring into his other work too. Chapter Four, ""Bukowski vs. 'Institution Art, '"" classifies this challenging author asboth populist and avant-garde. As general postmodern phenomenon, he blends the democratic accessibility of populist writing with the adventurous gesturing of the avant-garde, and the result is direct, daring, truthful, and funny. The book's conclusion, ""Summing Up: Giving Bukowski His Due,"" predicts that Bukowski will be read far into the 21st century.

50504,Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan,Ulrich Baer,"In a bold reassessment, this book analyzes the works of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan, two poets who frame our sense of modern poetry and define the beginning and end of modernity itself.The two poets share a feature that seems to block their placement in such an easy chronological or historical scheme: each accounts for an experience that will not fully enter memory, but dissipates in the mind in the form of trauma, fragments, and shock. While Baudelaire, as Paul Val√©ry was the first to show, explores the trauma of the minute personal shocks of everyday existence in modern life, Celan engages with the catastrophic magnitude of the Holocaust and how it has altered our understanding of history. Can we relate the shocks registered in Baudelaire‚Äôs poems to the historical horror addressed in Celan‚Äôs work without denying either the singularity of suffering and loss or the uniqueness of the historical event of the Shoah?Drawing on trauma studies and Holocaust research, Remnants of Song challenges existing interpretations of Baudelaire and Celan by constantly holding in view both the aesthetic dimension of their works and their historical import. The author demonstrates that the act of engaging with a poem on its own terms may serve as an important model for an ethical response to the radical experiences of trauma. Answering Adorno‚Äôs famous dictum that there can be no poetry after Auschwitz, he shows that Celan‚Äôs poetry continues to posit its own truth by drawing on Baudelaire as a precedent‚Äîyet it does so in ways that have little to do with conventional understandings of history.",4.18,0804739277,9780804739276,September 1st 2000 by Stanford University Press,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407813310l/50504.jpg
50505,Alchemy and Amalgam: Translation in the Works of Charles Baudelaire,Emily Salines,"Alchemy and Amalgam explores a relatively un-researched area of the Baudelairean corpus (his translations from English) and relates them to the rest of his works. It seeks to establish a link between translational and creative writing, arguing for a reassessment of the place of translation in Baudelaire's writing method. Rather than a sideline in Baudelaire's creative activities, translation is thus shown to be a central form of dual writing at the core of his works. Baudelaire's translations from English, his constant rewriting of pre-existing material (including his own), the doublets, the transpositions d'art, and the art criticism are all based on an approach to writing which is essentially derivative but also transformative. Thus the Baudelairean experiment illustrates the limits of romantic notions of originality, creativity and genius, reminding us that all writing is intrinsically intertextual. It also shows the complexity of translation as a form of creation at the core of modern writing. The book is one of the first of its kind to link the study the translational activity of a major writer to his 'creative' writings. It is also one of the first to provide an integrated presentation of French 19th-century translation approaches and to link them to questions of copyright and authorship in the context of the rise of capitalism and romantic views of creation and genius. It offers, therefore, a new perspective both on translation history and on literary history. Alchemy and Amalgam will be of interest to students of translation, comparative literature and French studies.",4.00,904201931X,9789042019317,January 1st 2004 by Brill/Rodopi,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386922698l/50505.jpg

50517,Wanted! The Search for Nazis in America,Howard Blum,"Recent news stories of WWII Nazi executioners living placid middle-class lives in the USA will give momentum to Blum's eerie tale of the hunters & the hunted. Like Hermine Ryan, the Queens housewife recently extradited to W. Germany, Tscherim Soobzokov, Valerian Trifa, Andrija Artukovic & Boleslavs Maikovski arrived here as displaced persons fleeing the communists. The Immigration & Naturalization Service--whether it knew of their previous identities or not--was, allegedly, more than willing to let them live unmolested. Soobzokov prospered as a Patterson, NJ, Democrat & leader of that town's Circassian community; Trifa became a Bishop of the Rumanian Orthodox Episcopate in MI. The men obsessed with tracking & unmasking them as mass murderers were an equally unlikely bunch. Tony DeVito, an INS official involved in the Ryan case, was a monomaniacal crusader; a Rumanian Jewish dentist pursued Trifa for 32 years; Maikovski's nemesis was a NYC waiter. As they compiled their dossiers on the neighborly, Americanized East Europeans, these men--DeVito most especially--succumbed to paranoia. Or did they? INS files mysteriously vanished; mounds of evidence forwarded to that bureau were received with indifference if not hostility; eyewitness testimony from Jewish survivors was deemed insufficient for government action. DeVito & others grew certain that ""the fix"" was in, that an ""Odessa organization has infiltrated the inner reaches of our government."" Does author Blum believe this? He chooses not to say; like a good novelist he writes from inside the tormented heads of DeVito, dentist Charlie Kremer & the rest. Suspense runs high as Blum drops frightful bits of circumstantial evidence without ever sticking his own neck out. Blum also notes that many of those ""willing to forget"" are Jews. As this stands it's an engrossing detective drama with the coverup left moot & the moral issues shelved. But one thing is sure--you'll be hearing more about these cases.--Kirkus",3.66,0671676075,9780671676070,September 1st 1989 by First Glance Books (first published 1976),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500056131l/50517.jpg

Here is the familiar outer world of family summers at remote lakes, winters of political activism, and seasons of exotic friends, mundane lives, and unexpected loves. But here too is the inner world of hidden places and all that emerges from them-the intimately personal, the fantastic, the shockingly real...whether it's what lives in a mysterious locked room or the secret feelings we all conceal. In this dramatic and far-ranging collection, Margaret Atwood proves why she is a true master of the genre.",3.73,0385491042,9780385491044,January 20th 1998 by Anchor (first published 1983),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386922020l/50536.jpg

Unlike the Bluebeard of popular fiction who murdered his wives, Gilles de Rais committed vile acts against children, mostly young boys.

50540,Secrets Beyond the Door: The Story of Bluebeard and His Wives,Maria Tatar,"The tale of Bluebeard's Wife--the story of a young woman who discovers that her mysterious blue-bearded husband has murdered his former spouses--no longer squares with what most parents consider good bedtime reading for their children. But the story has remained alive for adults, allowing it to lead a rich subterranean existence in novels ranging from Jane Eyre to Lolita and in films as diverse as Hitchcock's Notorious and Jane Campion's The Piano.In this fascinating work, Maria Tatar analyzes the many forms the tale of Bluebeard's Wife has taken over time, particularly in Anglo-European popular culture. It documents the fortunes of Bluebeard, his wife, and their marriage in folklore, fiction, film, and opera, showing how others took the Bluebeard theme and revived it with their own signature twists.In some tales the wife is a deceiver; in others she is a clever investigator. Earlier ages denounced Bluebeard's wife for her ""reckless curiosity"" and for her ""uncontrolled appetite""; our own times have turned her into something of a heroine, a woman who rescues herself--and often her marriage--through her detective work and psychological finesse. And as for Bluebeard? Once considered a one-dimensional brute, he has found renewed cultural energy both as a master criminal who kills in order to create a higher moral order and as an artist figure who must shield himself against intimacy to foster his creative powers. A brilliant account of how one classic fairy tale has been continually reincarnated, Secrets beyond the Door will appeal to both literary scholars and general readers.",4.18,0691127832,9780691127835,October 3rd 2006 by Princeton University Press (first published 2004),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348751299l/50540.jpg

However, many students today find the novel difficult to read and understand because of its language and its setting; especially challenging to some are the sections in which characters speak in the Yorkshire dialect. This guide provides an easy-to-use glossary of that dialect and translations of the dialogue.

50565,Blind Oracles: Intellectuals and War from Kennan to Kissinger,Bruce Kuklick,"In this trenchant analysis, historian Bruce Kuklick examines the role of intellectuals in foreign policymaking. He recounts the history of the development of ideas about strategy and foreign policy during a critical period in American history: the era of the nuclear standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union.The book looks at how the country's foremost thinkers advanced their ideas during this time of United States expansionism, a period that culminated in the Vietnam War and dÔøΩtente with the Soviets. Beginning with George Kennan after World War II, and concluding with Henry Kissinger and the Vietnam War, Kuklick examines the role of both institutional policymakers such as those at The Rand Corporation and Harvard's Kennedy School, and individual thinkers including Paul Nitze, McGeorge Bundy, and Walt Rostow.Kuklick contends that the figures having the most influence on American strategy--Kissinger, for example--clearly understood the way politics and the exercise of power affects policymaking. Other brilliant thinkers, on the other hand, often played a minor role, providing, at best, a rationale for policies adopted for political reasons. At a time when the role of the neoconservatives' influence over American foreign policy is a subject of intense debate, this book offers important insight into the function of intellectuals in foreign policymaking.",3.33,0691123497,9780691123493,February 1st 2006 by Princeton University Press (first published 2006),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170369718l/50565.jpg
50566,Ending the Vietnam War: A History of America's Involvement in and Extrication from the Vietnam War,Henry Kissinger,"The Definitive Account  Many other authors have written about what they thought happened -- or thought should have happened -- in Vietnam, but it was Henry Kissinger who was there at the epicenter, involved in every decision from the long, frustrating negotiations with the North Vietnamese delegation to America's eventual extrication from the war. Now, for the first time, Kissinger gives us in a single volume an in-depth, inside view of the Vietnam War, personally collected, annotated, revised, and updated from his bestselling memoirs and his book Diplomacy.  Here, Kissinger writes with firm, precise knowledge, supported by meticulous documentation that includes his own memoranda to and replies from President Nixon. He tells about the tragedy of Cambodia, the collateral negotiations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the disagreements within the Nixon and Ford administrations, the details of all negotiations in which he was involved, the domestic unrest and protest in the States, and the day-to-day military to diplomatic realities of the war as it reached the White House. As compelling and exciting as Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August, Ending the Vietnam War also reveals insights about the bigger-than-life personalities -- Johnson, Nixon, de Gaulle, Ho Chi Minh, Brezhnev -- who were caught up in a war that forever changed international relations. This is history on a grand scale, and a book of overwhelming importance to the public record.",3.67,074321532X,9780743215329,February 11th 2003 by Simon Schuster (first published February 4th 2003),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385187181l/50566.jpg
50567,Crisis: The Anatomy of Two Major Foreign Policy Crises,Henry Kissinger,"By drawing upon hitherto unpublished transcripts of his telephone conversations during the Yom Kippur War (1973) and the last days of the Vietnam War (1975), Henry Kissinger reveals what goes on behind the scenes at the highest levels in a diplomatic crisis.  The two major foreign policy crises in this book, one successfully negotiated, one that ended tragically, were unique in that they moved so fast that much of the work on them had to be handled by telephone.  The longer of the two sections deals in detail with the Yom Kippur War and is full of revelations, as well as great relevancy: In Kissinger's conversations with Golda Meir, Israeli Prime Minister; Simcha Dinitz, Israeli ambassador to the U.S.; Mohamed el-Zayyat, the Egyptian Foreign Minister; Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S.; Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary General of the U.N.; and a host of others, as well as with President Nixon, many of the main elements of the current problems in the Middle East can be seen.  The section on the end of the Vietnam War is a tragic drama, as Kissinger tries to help his president and a divided nation through the final moments of a lost war. It is full of astonishing material, such as Kissinger's trying to secure the evacuation of a Marine company which, at the very last minute, is discovered to still be in Saigon as the city is about to fall, and his exchanges with Ambassador Martin in Saigon, who is reluctant to leave his embassy.  This is a book that presents perhaps the best record of the inner workings of diplomacy at the superheated pace and tension of real crisis.",3.56,0743249119,9780743249119,August 2nd 2004 by Simon Schuster (first published 2003),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400365920l/50567.jpg

50569,The Flawed Architect: Henry Kissinger and American Foreign Policy,Jussi M. Hanhim√§ki,"Henry Kissinger dominated American foreign relations like no other figure in recent history. He negotiated an end to American involvement in the Vietnam War, opened relations with Communist China, and orchestrated dÔøΩtente with the Soviet Union. Yet he is also the man behind the secret bombing of Cambodia and policies leading to the overthrow of Chile's President Salvador Allende. Which is more accurate, the picture of Kissinger the skilled diplomat or Kissinger the war criminal?In The Flawed Architect, the first major reassessment of Kissinger in over a decade, historian Jussi Hanhimaki paints a subtle, carefully composed portrait of America's most famous and infamous statesman. Drawing on extensive research from newly declassified files, the author follows Kissinger from his beginnings in the Nixon administration up to the current controversy fed by Christopher Hitchens over whether Kissinger is a war criminal. Hanhimaki guides the reader through White House power struggles and debates behind the Cambodia and Laos invasions, the search for a strategy in Vietnam, the breakthrough with China, and the unfolding of Soviet-American detente. Here, too, are many other international crises of the period--the Indo-Pakistani War, the Yom Kippur War, the Angolan civil war--all set against the backdrop of Watergate. Along the way, Hanhimaki sheds light on Kissinger's personal flaws--he was obsessed with secrecy and bureaucratic infighting in an administration that self-destructed in its abuse of power--as well as his great strengths as a diplomat. We see Kissinger negotiating, threatening and joking with virtually all of the key foreign leaders of the 1970s, from Mao to Brezhnev and Anwar Sadat to Golda Meir.  This well researched account brings to life the complex nature of American foreign policymaking during the Kissinger years.

This is also a collaboration: Auster's story of his typewriter, and of Messer's welcome, though somewhat unsettling, intervention into that story, illustrated with Messer's muscular, obsessive drawings and paintings of both author and machine.

50620,American Film and Society Since 1945,Leonard Quart,"Although films rarely act as mirror reflections of everyday reality, they are, nevertheless, powerful cultural expressions of the dreams and desires of the American public. In the third edition of their seminal work, Leonard Quart and Albert Auster provide a complete post-World War II survey of American cinema and its often complex and contradictory values. From the self-confident affirmations of the immediate postwar era, through the social and cinematic turbulence of the sixties and seventies, to the darker, more pessimistic works of the nineties, America cinema has reflected and refracted American concerns.While adhering to the chronological structure and critical premises of the previous editions, American Film and Society Since 1945, Third Edition, adds key analyses of post-Cold War and Clinton-era cinema. While films of the nineties evoked no single political or cultural current, their diversity provides a panoramic view of this most complicated time. Movies that reaffirmed American patriotism (Saving Private Ryan) and debunked its politics (Bulworth), explored life in the inner city (Boyz N the Hood), dealt with homosexuality (Philadelphia), women's issues (Thelma & Louise), suburbia (American Beauty), and sexuality (Eyes Wide Shut) add up to a decade as multifaceted as any that Quart and Auster have considered. No other work provides such an exhaustive and rigorous account of this parallel history of the United States.

The story of one of America's most dysfunctoinal families, it is a ferocious, uproarious attack on the substitution of artificial values for real values-a startling tale of murder and morality that rocks middle-class ethics to its complacent foundations.The Zoo Story is a harrowing depiction of a young man alienated from the human race-a searing story of loneliness and the desperate need for recognition that builds to a violent, shattering climax.

(1963), and the Pulitzer Prize-winning A Delicate Balance (1966), Albee's unsparing indictment of the American way of life earned him early distinction as the dramatist of his generation.

50651,Powerbook,Jeanette Winterson,"""What happened to the omniscient author?""""Gone interactive.""While many other novels are still nursing hangovers from the 20th century, Jeanette Winterson's The.PowerBook has risen early to greet the challenge of the new millennium. Set in cyberspace, The.PowerBook travels with ease. It casts the net of its love story over Paris, Capri and London. Interactive narrator Ali is a ""language costumier"" who will swathe your imagination in the clothes of transformation. All you have to do is decide who you want to be. Ali--known also as Alix--is a virtual narrator in a networked world of e-writing. You are the reader, invited to inhabit the story--any story--you wish to be told. Like all the best video games you can choose your location, your character, even the clothes you want to wear. Beware, you can enter and play the game, but you cannot determine its outcome.  Ali/x is a digital Orlando for the modern age, moving across time and through transmutations of identity, weaving her stories with ""long lines of laptop DNA"" and shaping herself to the reader's desire. Ali/x wants to make love as simple as a song. But even in cyberspace there is no love without pain. Ali/x offers a stranger on the other side of the screen the opportunity of freedom for one night. She falls in love with her beautiful stranger, and finds herself reinvented by her own story.  The.PowerBook is rich with historical allegory and literary allusion. Winterson's dialogue crackles with humour, snappy dialogue and good jokes, several of which are at the author's own expense. This is a world of disguise, boundary crossing and emotional diversions that change the navigation of the plot of life. Strangely sprouting tulips are erected in place of the phallus. Husbands and wives are uncoupled. Lovers disappear in the night to escape from themselves. On the hard drive of the The.PowerBook are stored a variety of stories which the reader can download and open at will, complete stories that loop through the central narrative. The tale of Mallory's third expedition, the disinterring of a Roman Governor in Spitalfields Church or the contemplation of ""great and ruinous lovers"" are capsules of narrative compression. In Winterson's compacted meaning, language becomes a character in its own right--it is one of the heroes of the novel.  ""What I am seeking to do in my work is to make a form that answers to 21st-century needs,"" Winterson wrote in ""A Work of My Own"". The.PowerBook answers these needs. Winterson's prose has found a metaphor for its linguistic forms of creation that feels almost invented for her, ""a web of co-ordinates that will change the world."" There will be a virtual rush of Internet-themed books in the networked noughties. With The.PowerBook Winterson has triumphantly got there first. --Rachel Holmes ",3.67,,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170370865l/50651.jpg

Yet neither seeks to regain its former military power; on the contrary, antimilitarism has become so deeply rooted in the Japanese and German national psyches that even such questions as participation in international peacekeeping forces are met with widespread domestic opposition.

50671,Best Friends,Thomas Berger,"Since childhood, Sam Grandy and Roy Courtright have been best friends. They grew up in the same prosperous community, went to the same prep school, and later entered the same university. After Sam's father died, Roy's father looked after him. At one point Sam dated Roy's sister, Robin. As best friends, they share a close and loving bond, often stronger than the relationships other men share with their girlfriends, siblings, or wives.  But in the twenty years since their friendship began, their fundamental differences have become more apparent and their relationship has grown strained. More and more often they realize they are opposites -- one a womanizer, the other a devoted husband; one careless with money, the other frugal; one independent, the other needy. Do these differences threaten their friendship -- or are the dissimilarities what make it possible? Can they escape the ties of their past, or are they intrinsically bound until death? When Sam's health begins to falter, he draws Roy into his life again -- and into a chain of deceit, sex, delusion, death, and love such as only a best friend could.  Thomas Berger has enthralled millions of readers for almost fifty years with his psychologically complex, sharp-sighted storytelling.

50675,Thomas Berger,Brooks Landon,"Understanding Thomas Berger introduces readers to a veteran novelist best known for his wry explorations of the dialectic between the great American dream and the realities of middle-class American life, a frustrating nexus where characters might win knowledge and language but still lack opportunity for action. As Brooks Landon notes in this survey of Bergeras impressive body of work, this author openly resists easy classification. Indeed Bergeras uncanny ability to satirize literary genres while participating in them has defined his career and led to such novels as his classic Westerns Little Big Man and The Return of Little Big Man, his hard-boiled detective story Who Is Teddy Villanova?, his Arthurian romance Arthur Rex, and his epic Reinhart series. Landon approaches these works thematically to advance understanding of Bergeras motives, influences, techniques, style, and languageaand it is language that seems key to unlocking Bergeras puzzle. According to Landon, the limitations of language and its competition with thought are most central to the conflict for Bergeras characters. Having written twenty-three novels since 1958, Berger is remarkably productive and has garnered a loyal following of devotees willing to travel with him from genre to genre, but he has always been a bit too intelligent, too edgy, and too hard to indentify to attract a wide audience of mainstream readers. Landonas approaches to Berger in the present volume carve fresh inroads for readers into the complex literary landscape of this grimly comic moralist and master of fictionas many forms.",4.50,,,June 1st 1989 by Twayne Publishers,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/blank-133x176-8b769f39ba6687a82d2eef30bdf46977.jpg

The interviews in this collection portray the many additional sides of the Harlem-born author and activist. She was also a rebellious child of Caribbean parents, a mastectomy patient, a blue-collar worker, a college professor, a student of African mythology, an experimental autobiographer in her book titled Zami, a critic of imperialism, and a charismatic orator.Despite her intense engagement with the major social movements of her time, Lorde told interviewers that she was always an outsider, a position of weakness and of strength.Most of her schoolmates were white. She married a white legal-aid attorney, and after their divorce she was the partner of a white psychologist for many years. These intimate alliances with whites caused some African Americans of both genders to question the depth of her solidarity. Lorde expressed distrust of some white feminists and charged that they lacked real understanding of African American struggles.Writing proved to be her powerful weapon against injustice. Painfully aware that differences could provoke prejudice and violence, she promoted the bridging of barriers. These interviews reveal the sense of displacement that made Lorde a champion of the outcast and the forgotten--whether in New York, Mississippi, Berlin, or Soweto.",4.42,1578066433,9781578066438,May 17th 2004 by University Press of Mississippi,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348534189l/50681.jpg

But it is Irving‚Äôs mastery of suspense, characterization, tempo, and irony that transforms his fiction into virtuoso performances, earning him his reputation as the father of the American short story. Charles Neider has gathered all sixty-one of Irving's tales, originally scattered throughout his many collections of nonfiction essays and sketches, into one magnificent volume. Together, they reveal his wide range: besides the expected classics like ""Rip Van Winkle,"" ""The Spectre Bridegroom,"" ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" and ""The Devil and Tom Walker,"" his fiction embraces realistic tales, ghost stories, parodies, legends, fables, and satires.

50705,The Collected Stories,Leonard Michaels,"Leonard Michaels was a master of the short story. His collections are among the most admired, influential, and exciting of the last half century. The Collected Stories brings them back into print, from the astonishing debut Going Places (1969) to the uncollected last stories, unavailable since they appeared in The New Yorker, Threepenny Review, and Partisan Review.At every stage in his career, Michaels produced taut, spare tales of sex, love, and other adult intimacies: gossip, argument, friendship, guilt, rage. A fearless writer‚Äî""destructive, joyful, brilliant, purely creative,"" in the words of John Hawkes‚ÄîMichaels probed his characters' motivations with brutal humor and startling frankness; his ear for the vernacular puts him in the company of Philip Roth, Grace Paley, and Bernard Malamud.

50721,Utopia Parkway: The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell,Deborah Solomon,"No artist ever led a stranger life than Joseph Cornell (1903-72), the self-taught American genius prized for his enchanting and disquieting shadow boxes, an art form all his own. By now, many legends surround Cornell: that of the painfully shy hermit lost in a world of books, silent movies, and long-gone ballerinas; that of the patiently devoted caretaker who would rush home from an afternoon at the Manhattan galleries to minister to his mother and invalid brother; that of the artistic innocent whose creations emerged as happy accidents from his hands. Yet Cornell and his work were cherished by the leading avant-garde figures of his day, and artists who agreed on little else agreed on Cornell's originality. Utopia Parkway - the product of Deborah Solomon's decade of sustained attention to Cornell, and the first serious biography of him - reveals him as a brilliant and relentlessly serious artist whose works are among the monuments of modern art. Admired by successive generations of vanguard artists - the Surrealists of the 1940s, tbe Abstract Expressionists of the 1950s the Pop artists of the 1960s - Cornell cultivated friendships with artists as diverse as Marcel Duchamp, Willem de Kooning, and Andy Warhol. He had romantically charged encounters with women, including Tamara Toumanova, Susan Sontag, and Yoko Ono, and unrequited crushes on anonymous waitresses and shop girls. All this he recorded compulsively in a diary, which stands with the boxes themselves as a strange and affecting record of his extravagant inner life.",4.08,0374180121,9780374180126,March 1st 1997 by Farrar Straus Giroux,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386745681l/50721.jpg

History has loved her little better. Nancy Mitford's delightfully candid biography recreates the spirit of 18th-century Versailles with its love of pleasure and treachery. We learn that the Queen was a ""bore,"" the Dauphin a ""prig,"" and see France increasingly overcome with class conflict.

50775,Selected Tales and Sketches,Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Librarian Note: 31 Selections; Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780140390575The short fiction of a writer who helped to shape the course of American literature. With a determined commitment to the history of his native land, Nathaniel Hawthorne revealed, more incisively than any writer of his generation, the nature of a distinctly American consciousness. The pieces collected here deal with essentially American matters: the Puritan past, the Indians, the Revolution. But Hawthorne was highly ‚Äì often wickedly ‚Äì unorthodox in his account of life in early America, and his precisely constructed plots quickly engage the reader‚Äôs imagination. Written in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s, these works are informed by themes that reappear in Hawthorne‚Äôs longer works: The Scarlet Letter, The House of the Seven Gables and The Blithedale Romance. And, as Michael J. Colacurcio points out in his excellent introduction, they are themes that are now deeply embedded in the American literary tradition.--back coverHollow of the Three HillsSir William PhipsMrs. HutchinsonWives of the DeadMy Kinsman, Major MolineuxRoger Malvin's BurialPassages from a Relinquished WorkMr. Higginbotham's CatastropheHaunted MindAlice Doane's AppealGray ChampionYoung Goodman BrownWakefieldNotch of the White MountainsAmbitious GuestMay-Pole of Merry MountMinister's Black VeilSunday at HomeMan of AdamantEndicott and the Red CrossNight SketchesLegens of the Province-HouseHall of FantasyBirthmarkEgotism; or the Bosom-SerpentChristmas BanquetCelestial RailroadEarth's HolocaustArtist of the BeautifulRappacini‚Äôs DaughterEthan Brand",4.03,,,1987 by Penguin Books (first published January 1st 1959),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170371552l/50775.jpg

The quest is replete with dangers and pitfalls, but it offers great rewards: the capacity to be successful in the world, knowledge of the mysteries of the human soul, and the opportunity to find and express your unique gifts in the world.""In this bold and original work, Carol S. Pearson shows that the heroic quest isn't just for certain people under special circumstances. Exploring the many heroic paths available to each of us, at every point in our lives, her innovative program enables us to live heroically by activating and applying twelve archetypes in our lives.This companion to the bestselling The Hero Within outlines twelve archetypal patterns that can aid inner development and the quest for wholeness.These archetypes are inner guides that can help us prepare for the journey, by learning how to become successful members of society; embark upon the quest, by becoming initiated into the mysteries of the human soul; and return to transform our lives as a result of claiming our uniqueness and personal power.Writing for individuals seeking to realize their full potential and professionals engaged in empowering others, Pearson shows how journeys differ by the age, gender, and cultural background of the seeker, and how archetypes help awaken the capacities of our psyches. A unique diagnostic test, the Heroic Myth Index, and exercises are included to help us understand and awaken our inner guides.AuthorBiography: Carol S.

A secret research facility in the Colorado mountains is the US Army's last outpost after defeat by the PanAsians. The conquerors had absorbed the USSR after being attacked by them & had then absorbed India. They're ruthless, having crushed a rebellion by killing 150,000 civilians as punishment. The lab is in turmoil. All but six of the personnel have died due to unknown forces released by an experiment operating within the newly-discovered magneto-gravitic or electro-gravitic spectra. Survivors learn they can selectively kill by releasing the internal pressure of cell membranes. This weapon can kill one race while leaving others unharmed. They devise more uses for the forces discovered, but how do a handful overthrow an occupation that controls all communications & makes it criminal to print English?

He must be 23 to 25 years old, in perfect health, at least six feet tall, weigh about 190 pounds, fluent English, with some French, proficient in all weapons, some knowledge of engineering and mathematics essential, willing to travel, no family or emotional ties, indomitably courageous and handsome of face and figure.

A pretty appropriate name, as it turned out, for the empress of twenty universes.Robert A. Heinlein's one true fantasy novel, Glory Road is as much fun today as when he wrote it after Stranger in a Strange Land. Heinlein proves himself as adept with sword and sorcery as with rockets and slide rules and the result is exciting, satirical, fast-paced, funny and tremendously readable -- a favorite of all who have read it.

Travel to other planets is a reality, and with overpopulation stretching the resources of Earth, the necessity to find habitable worlds is growing ever more urgent. With no time to wait years for communication between slower-than-light spaceships and home, the Long Range Foundation explores an unlikely solution--human telepathy. 
Identical twins Tom and Pat are enlisted to be the human radios that will keep the ships in contact with Earth, but one of them has to stay behind while the other explores the depths of space.This is one of Heinlein's triumphs.

50869,The Great Science Fiction of Robert A. Heinlein,Robert A.

Michael is raised by Martians, and he arrives on Earth as a true innocent: he has never seen a woman and has no knowledge of Earth's cultures or religions. But he brings turmoil with him, as he is the legal heir to an enormous financial empire, not to mention de facto owner of the planet Mars. With the irascible popular author Jubal Harshaw to protect him, Michael explores human morality and the meanings of love. He founds his own church, preaching free love and disseminating the psychic talents taught him by the Martians. Ultimately, he confronts the fate reserved for all messiahs. The impact of Stranger in a Strange Land was considerable, leading many children of the 60's to set up households based on Michael's water-brother nests. Heinlein loved to pontificate through the mouths of his characters, so modern readers must be willing to overlook the occasional sour note (""Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault."").

50876,Time for the Stars,Robert A. Heinlein,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewThere's a completely unwarranted stigma attached to science fiction and fantasy books that are labeled as ""all-ages"" reads. Some of the most influential books ever written in the genre have this tag: Tolkien's The Hobbit, Le Guin's Earthsea trilogy, Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, etc. Arguably the most historically significant collection of ""all-ages"" science fiction novels are Robert A. Heinlein's 12 juvenile books written for Scribner's in the 1940s and '50s. While the intended readership was originally teenage boys, these adventure novels -- as thematically challenging as they were diverse -- have been just as appealing to adults over the decades and have collectively been the inspiration for hundreds of modern-day sci-fi novels. One of the most popular ""Heinlein juveniles"" is Time for the Stars, a novel about two identical twin boys -- Patrick and Thomas Bartlett -- who become involved in a highly dangerous deep-space exploratory mission to seek out inhabitable planets to further humankind's colonization of the stars. The entire undertaking hinges on the ability of a very elite group of twins to communicate with one another instantaneously through telepathy. While one twin is stationed on Earth, the other is hurtling through space at almost the speed of light. But when thrill-seeking Pat is involved in a ski accident just days before the spaceship departs, Tom is called upon to leave everything behind and embark on the adventure of a lifetime. Heinlein's Time for the Stars -- as well as other of his juvenile works, like Red Planet and Space Cadet -- are not only great reads for adult genre fans but also perfect novels to share with school-age children: not only to discuss the thought-provoking themes (population control, etc.) but to talk about how dramatically American culture has changed since these books have been written. For example, the portrayal of women in 1956 -- when Time for the Stars was written -- is more than a little shocking. An ""all-ages"" science fiction classic -- stigma not included.

Even as he grew up and was estranged from his community, his religion and its traditions, he could not find his way to a life where he didn't struggle against God daily. ""Foreskin's Lament"" reveals Auslander's youth in a strict, socially isolated Orthodox community, and recounts his rebellion and efforts to make a new life apart from it. Auslander remembers his youthful attempt to win the ""blessing bee"" (the Orthodox version of a spelling bee), his exile to an Orthodox-style reform school in Israel after he's caught shoplifting Union Bay jeans from the mall, and his fourteen mile hike to watch the New York Rangers play in Madison Square Garden without violating the Sabbath. Throughout, Auslander struggles to understand God and His complicated, often contradictory laws. He tries to negotiate with God and His representatives-a day of sin-free living for a day of indulgence, a blessing for each profanity. But ultimately, Shalom settles for a peaceful cease-fire, a standoff with God, and accepts the very slim remaining hope that his newborn son might live free of guilt, doubt, and struggle. Auslander's combination of unrelenting humor and anger--one that draws comparisons to memoirists David Sedaris and Dave Eggers--renders a rich and fascinating portrait of a man grappling with his faith, family, and community.",3.85,1594489556,9781594489556,October 4th 2007 by Riverhead Books (first published 2007),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442421923l/50902._SY475_.jpg

50924,Rules for the World: International Organizations in Global Politics,Michael Barnett,"Rules for the World provides an innovative perspective on the behavior of international organizations and their effects on global politics. Arguing against the conventional wisdom that these bodies are little more than instruments of states, Michael Barnett and Martha Finnemore begin with the fundamental insight that international organizations are bureaucracies that have authority to make rules and so exercise power. At the same time, Barnett and Finnemore maintain, such bureaucracies can become obsessed with their own rules, producing unresponsive, inefficient, and self-defeating outcomes. Authority thus gives international organizations autonomy and allows them to evolve and expand in ways unintended by their creators.Barnett and Finnemore reinterpret three areas of activity that have prompted extensive policy debate: the use of expertise by the IMF to expand its intrusion into national economies; the redefinition of the category refugees and decision to repatriate by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; and the UN Secretariat's failure to recommend an intervention during the first weeks of the Rwandan genocide. By providing theoretical foundations for treating these organizations as autonomous actors in their own right, Rules for the World contributes greatly to our understanding of global politics and global governance.",3.82,0801440904,9780801440908,October 12th 2004 by Cornell University Press,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170372814l/50924.jpg

50933,Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds,Jesper  Juul,"A video game is half-real: we play by real rules while imagining a fictional world. We win or lose the game in the real world, but we slay a dragon (for example) only in the world of the game. In this thought-provoking study, Jesper Juul examines the constantly evolving tension between rules and fiction in video games. Discussing games from ""Pong"" to ""The Legend of Zelda,"" from chess to ""Grand Theft Auto,"" he shows how video games are both a departure from and a development of traditional non-electronic games. The book combines perspectives from such fields as literary and film theory, computer science, psychology, economic game theory, and game studies, to outline a theory of what video games are, how they work with the player, how they have developed historically, and why they are fun to play.Locating video games in a history of games that goes back to Ancient Egypt, Juul argues that there is a basic affinity between games and computers. Just as the printing press and the cinema have promoted and enabled new kinds of storytelling, computers work as enablers of games, letting us play old games in new ways and allowing for new kinds of games that would not have been possible before computers. Juul presents a classic game model, which describes the traditional construction of games and points to possible future developments. He examines how rules provide challenges, learning, and enjoyment for players, and how a game cues the player into imagining its fictional world. Juul's lively style and eclectic deployment of sources will make ""Half-Real"" of interest to media, literature, and game scholars as well as to game professionals and gamers.",3.89,0262101106,9780262101103,November 4th 2005 by MIT Press (MA),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389754605l/50933.jpg

50950,The Mark: The Beast Rules The World,Tim LaHaye,"It's the dawn of the Great Tribulation, ""the bloodiest season in the history of the world."" After lying in state for three days, Nicolae Carpathia has risen from the dead. As the world responds in awe, statues of the potentate and ""god"" are erected in every major city, and a new religion, ""Carpathianism,"" is in full swing. Followers of the antichrist are branded with a loyalty mark on their right hands or their foreheads, and ""vaccinated"" with a biochip embedded with personal information. Those who refuse the mark take a one-way trip to the guillotine. The second coming of Christ is only three-and-one-half years away. But can the Tribulation Force hang on? ""The God who calls you to the ultimate sacrifice will also give you the power to endure it. No one can receive the mark of the beast by accident. It is a once-and-for-all decision that will forever condemn you to eternity without God,"" writes Tsion Ben-Judah in his daily newsletter with its cyberaudience of more than a billion. Heavenly power may be the only hope for the Tribulation Force, as it struggles to survive amidst new terrors, the death of more loved ones, and some unexpected twists in its plans. The Mark: The Beast Rules the World is the eighth installment in the blockbuster Left Behind series. Rich in dialogue, this action-packed thriller delivers the same consistent mix of apocalyptic mayhem and quirky humor readers have come to expect from the pen of Jerry Jenkins and the prophetic interpretations of Tim LaHaye. --Cindy Crosby__________Unabridged, 7 compact discs, 8 hours 45 minutes",4.02,0788749692,9780788749698,November 17th 2000 by Recorded Books (first published November 14th 2000),https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/blank-133x176-8b769f39ba6687a82d2eef30bdf46977.jpg
50951,Defense Positioning and Geometry: Rules for a World with Low Force Levels,Raj Gupta,"With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in Europe and the end of the Cold war, many of the long-standing political and ideological obstacles to minimizing force levels have been removed. The overriding issue is no longer who commands the greatest force divisions; rather, the immediate concern is to establish a minimum threshold to which nations may reduce their force levels and still retain a meaningful defense.In this book, Raj Gupta examines the geometry and positioning of conventional forces, especially at low force levels. Defense Positioning and Geometry uncovers certain spatial relationships that the defending commander must abide by for an effective defense and shows how they can be exploited to construct stable military balances and reduce forces to minimum levels. The author considers a number of important questions that must be addressed to establish a new order of low force levels, such as: What is the absolute minimum force density necessary for a coherent and robust defense? How deep can mutual cuts go without irreparably damaging defense capability and upsetting conventional stability? How should an arms control treaty that cuts deployed forces by 50 percent or more be structured?There is an urgency to develop general, universally applicable principles that dictate how conventional forces should be optimally structured. Such principles, once defined, are certainly applicable directly on the battlefield‚Äîin the civil wars in Yugoslavia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and in the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent response. However, as the author demonstrates, these fundamental defense positioning rules can be employed more constructively in the task of dismantling the redundant firepower amassed by NATO, the Warsaw Pact countries, the Middle East, North and South Korea, and the China-India-Pakistan axis. The book shows how knowledge of the ideal force geometry at low force levels makes it possible to determine the arms control regimes necessary to fill any holes exposed by deep cuts.",0.00,0815733127,9780815733126,September 1st 1993 by Brookings Institution Press (first published 1993),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347878353l/50951.jpg

50955,Integrating Implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Rules of the World Trade Organization,David R. Downes,"In the 1990s, the international community placed both biodiversity protection and trade liberalization high on its agenda, resulting in the formation of global agreements and institutions, such as the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Distinct in character, they are increasingly linked through the many ways that trade rules affect biodiversity. Developing separately and involving very different communities, there is a risk that the rules and policies of one regime could hinder the effectiveness of the other. This publication seeks to encourage sustainable development by examining and building upon the complementary aspects of these two international regimes. It describes specific proposals fo resolving or avoiding conflicts and for promoting synergies, including opportunities to support effective implementation of the trade-related aspects of the CBD.

50964,Simple Rules for a Complex World,Richard A. Epstein,"Too many laws, too many lawyers--that's the necessary consequence of a complex society, or so conventional wisdom has it. Countless pundits insist that any call for legal simplification smacks of nostalgia, sentimentality, or naivete. But the conventional view, the noted legal scholar Richard Epstein tells us, has it exactly backward. The richer texture of modern society allows for more individual freedom and choice. And it allows us to organize a comprehensive legal order capable of meeting the technological and social challenges of today on the basis of just six core principles. In this book, Epstein demonstrates how.The first four rules, which regulate human interactions in ordinary social life, concern the autonomy of the individual, property, contract, and tort. Taken together these rules establish and protect consistent entitlements over all resources, both human and natural. These rules are backstopped by two more rules that permit forced exchanges on payment of just compensation when private or public necessity so dictates. Epstein then uses these six building blocks to clarify many intractable problems in the modern legal landscape. His discussion of employment contracts explains the hidden virtues of contracts at will and exposes the crippling weaknesses of laws regarding collective bargaining, unjust dismissal, employer discrimination, and comparable worth. And his analysis shows how laws governing liability for products and professional services, corporate transactions, and environmental protection have generated unnecessary social strife and economic dislocation by violating these basic principles.""Simple Rules for a Complex World"" offers a sophisticated agenda for comprehensive social reform that undoes much of the mischief of the modern regulatory state. At a time when most Americans have come to distrust and fear government at all levels, Epstein shows how a consistent application of economic and political theory allows us to steer a middle path between too much and too little.",4.03,0674808207,9780674808201,March 17th 1998 by Harvard University Press (first published 1995),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387713252l/50964.jpg

50967,Ruling Your World: Ancient Strategies For Modern Life,Sakyong Mipham,"You‚Äôre stuck in the airport security line, late for a flight. The line isn‚Äôt moving. You‚Äôre angry at the security personnel for taking so long, you‚Äôre irritated at the other passengers for having so much stuff, you‚Äôre mad at your boss for sending you on this trip in the first place. By the time you get to your gate you‚Äôre angry, deflated, and exhausted. Then someone cuts in front of you in the line to board and you snap. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a line, you know!‚Äù Is that really you, standing in an airport, yelling at a stranger, emotions raging? It happens to most of us more than we‚Äôd like to admit. In an instant, our lives seem out of control and overwhelming. It‚Äôs always something, isn‚Äôt it? But what if you could approach every part of your life‚Äîfrom the smallest decisions to life‚Äôs biggest setbacks‚Äîwith total confidence, clarity, and control? According to Sakyong Mipham, we all have that power. The secret is simple: If you just stop thinking about yourself all the time, happiness and confidence will come naturally. It sounds absurd and, what‚Äôs more, impossible. But in Ruling Your World, Sakyong Mipham shares ancient secrets on how to take control of our lives and be successful while cultivating compassion for others and confidence in our own intelligence and goodness. The key to this well-being lies in the ancient strategies of the warrior kings and queens of Shambhala. The kingdom of Shambhala was an enlightened kingdom of benevolent kings and queens and fiercely trained warriors. No one knows for sure whether this kingdom was real or mythical, but there are ancient guidebooks to this land and practical instructions for creating a Shambhala in your own world, bringing peace, purpose, and perspective into your life and environment. Sakyong Mipham, the descendant of a warrior king, has inherited these teachings and gives us the lessons and myths of the great rulers and warriors of Shambhala. He makes these teachings relevant to our twenty-first-century lives in a fresh and witty voice and helps us all to realize our potential for power and control in a seemingly uncontrollable world.For the first time ever, revered spiritual leader Sakyong Mipham brings the lessons of the ancient Shambhala warriors and rulers to the Western world and shows us how to live our lives with confidence. Most of us are living in a haze‚Äîsometimes helping others, sometimes helping ourselves, sometimes happy, sometimes sad. We don‚Äôt feel in control of our own lives. The ancient teachings of Shambhala rulership show us that we all have the ability to rule our own world and live with confidence. To do this, we need to use our daily lives to be strong, as opposed to aggressive, and to act with wisdom and compassion. This may sound difficult, but when we begin to mix this ancient wisdom of rulership into our everyday life, we have both spiritual and worldly success. We don‚Äôt need to abandon our life and become an ascetic or a monk in order to gain confidence and achieve this success. We can live in the world as a ruler no matter what we are doing. ‚Äîfrom Ruling Your World ",4.18,0767920805,9780767920803,October 10th 2006 by Harmony (first published 2005),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924749l/50967.jpg

Combined, Mountain Directory West and Mountain Directory East give the locations and descriptions of over 700 mountain passes and steep grades in 22 states. This is vital information for anyone driving a large or heavy vehicle. The Mountain Directory books tell you where the steep grades are, how long they are, how steep (%) they are, whether the road is two lane, three lane, or four lane, if there are escape ramps, switchbacks, sharp curves, speed limits, etc. With this information, one can know ahead of time what a pass is like and make an informed decision about whether to go over or around. If you decide to go over, perhaps the cool morning hours would ease the strain on the engine and transmission during the climb.

51029,"The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast",Douglas Brinkley,"In the span of five violent hours on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed major Gulf Coast cities and flattened 150 miles of coastline. Yet those wind-torn hours represented only the first stage of the relentless triple tragedy that Katrina brought to the entire Gulf Coast, from Louisiana to Mississippi to Alabama.First came the hurricane, one of the three strongest ever to make landfall in the United States -- 150-mile-per-hour winds, with gusts measuring more than 180 miles per hour ripping buildings to pieces.Second, the storm-surge flooding, which submerged a half million homes, creating the largest domestic refugee crisis since the Civil War. Eighty percent of New Orleans was under water, as debris and sewage coursed through the streets, and whole towns in south-eastern Louisiana ceased to exist.And third, the human tragedy of government mis-management, which proved as cruel as the natural disaster itself. Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, implemented an evacuation plan that favored the rich and healthy. Kathleen Blanco, governor of Louisiana, dithered in the most important aspect of her job: providing leadership in a time of fear and confusion. Michael C. Brown, the FEMA director, seemed more concerned with his sartorial splendor than the specter of death and horror that was taking New Orleans into its grip.In The Great Deluge, bestselling author Douglas Brinkley, a New Orleans resident and professor of history at Tulane University, rips the story of Katrina apart and relates what the Category 3 hurricane was like from every point of view. The book finds the true heroes -- such as Coast Guard officer Jimmy Duckworth and hurricane jock Tony Zumbado.Throughout the book, Brinkley lets the Katrina survivors tell their own stories, masterly allowing them to record the nightmare that was Katrina. The Great Deluge investigates the failure of government at every level and breaks important new stories.

First published by Yale University Press in 1956, it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957 and has since sold more than one million copies. This edition includes a new foreword by Harold Bloom.The action covers a fateful, heart-rending day from around 8:30 am to midnight, in August 1912 at the seaside Connecticut home of the Tyrones - the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents at their home, Monte Cristo Cottage.One theme of the play is addiction and the resulting dysfunction of the family. All three males are alcoholics and Mary is addicted to morphine. They all constantly conceal, blame, resent, regret, accuse and deny in an escalating cycle of conflict with occasional desperate and half-sincere attempts at affection, encouragement and consolation.",4.05,3150092523,9783150092521,December 31st 1989 by Reclam Philipp Jun.

51053,Madame Bovary's Ovaries: A Darwinian Look At Literature,David Philip Barash,"What can elephant seals tell us about Homer‚Äôs Iliad? How do gorillas illuminate the works of Shakespeare? What do bloodsucking bats have to do with John Steinbeck? MADAME BOVARY‚ÄôS OVARIES A Darwinian Look at Literature According to evolutionary psychologist David Barash and his daughter Nanelle, the answers lie in the most important word in biology: evolution. Just like every animal from mites to monkeys, our day-to-day behavior has been shaped by millions of years of natural selection. So it should be no surprise to learn that the natural forces that drive animals in general and Homo sapiens in particular are clearly visible in the creatures of literature, from Henry Fielding‚Äôs Tom Jones all the way to Helen Fielding‚Äôs Bridget Jones. Seen through the lens of evolutionary biology, the witty repartee of Jane Austen‚Äôs courting couples, Othello‚Äôs tragic rage, the griping of Holden Caulfield, and the scandalous indiscretions of Madame Bovary herself all make a fresh and exciting kind of sense. The ways we fall in‚Äîand out‚Äîof love, stand by our friends, compete against our enemies, and squabble with our families have their roots in biological imperatives we share not only with other primates but with an amazing array of other creatures. The result is a new way to read, a novel approach to novels (and plays) that reveals how human nature underlies literature, from the great to the not-so-great.Using the cutting-edge ideas of contemporary Darwinism, the authors show how the heroes and heroines of our favorite stories have been molded as much by evolution as by the genius of their creators, revealing a gallery of characters from Agamemnon to Alexander Portnoy, who have more in common with birds, fish, and other mammals than we could ever have imagined.As engaging and informative as a good story, Madame Bovary‚Äôs Ovaries is both an accessible introduction to a fascinating area of science and a provocatively sideways look at our cherished literary heritage. Most of all, it shows in a delightfully enteraining way how science and literature shed light on each other.From the Hardcover edition.",3.36,0739463519,9780739463512,ils...Original TitleMadame Bovary's Ovaries: A Darwinian Look at LiteratureISBN 0739463519 (ISBN13: 9780739463512)Other Editions (8)All Editions | Add a New Edition | Combine...Less DetailEdit Details,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170373661l/51053.jpg

Here, for the first time in the West, a coalition form of government was created. The laws passed during the ""Riformatori"" era demonstrate that the voice of the lower class was finally heard. The eight revolutions and various disturbances that took place attest to the clamor for change.

51055,The Golden Mean,James S. Hans,"The Golden Mean reappraises the relationship among the three forms of good that exist in modern Western thought: the good of aesthetic beauty and performance, the good of right and wrong, and the forces of social resentment that shape the public debate about what is appropriate to society's needs.The book explores how the good found in aesthetics is linked to the good found in the ethical codes that govern people's lives. These goods interact with the sense of the community expressed in society's envy of those exemplary few who possess the powers of the aesthetic, even as they too must subscribe to the same strictures by which ordinary people live. The book also demonstrates how the concept of a middle path, a straight and narrow way, or a golden mean develops to provide a measure by which people can make sense out of these seemingly disparate phenomena.The Golden Mean argues that our current dilemmas both inside and outside the university should prompt us to see more clearly how the aesthetic and the ethical are intrinsically related.

51057,"Being Irrational: Lacon, The Objet A, And The Golden Mean",Shingu Kazushige,"This book was originally published in Japanese as Lacan's Psychoanalysis (Rakan no seishin-bunseki), and under that title it is the best-selling and widest-read introduction to Lacan in Japan. It is my belief, however, that the specific insights it affords into the objet a will make it fruitful reading for a much broader audience than the one it is confined to in Japanese; for this reason, I gladly accepted when Professor Shingu kindly offered me the chance to translate it. Professor Shingu and I have together chosen a new title for the English edition ? Being Irrational: Lacan, the Objet a, and the Golden Mean ? in keeping with the relevance we hope its unique exposition of the objet a in particular will hold for an English-reading audience. The objet a is a seminal notion in Lacan's thought, and Bruce Fink has justifiably remarked that an entire book would be required to explain it fully. While Being Irrational is not a systematic exposition of all the different formulations that have been given to the objet a, it is, in a sense, just such a book. It is ground-breaking in that it develops a hint from Seminar XX (along with a few pieces of algebra from Seminar XVII) to the effect that ""the objet a is the golden mean"", and makes of this notion a key to Lacan's entire theoretical edifice. This is the ""being irrational"" (or ""irrational being"") of the title. As we see in Chapters III and V, it is ""irrational"" both in the ordinary everyday sense of the word ? emotional, and not amenable to ""logical"" understanding ? and also numerically: the golden mean is an irrational number. In addition to the change of title, various other changes were also made in the course of the translation. Quotations, theoretical concepts, and details from Lacan's biography have been sourced. References to Japanese culture that would be lost on an outside audience in their original condensed form have been expanded. The translator and author have also co-operated to modify the text slightly in places, to make it read smoothly in English. In achieving the latter aim, we decided to move paragraph divisions in places, and we have also introduced some introductory and conclusory sections at the beginning and end of structural units such as chapters and sections. All such changes were made with the author's careful approval. In the few cases where changes bear on content, or where substantial passages were added, the fact is noted. A note is also required on the use of the pronoun ""I"". In many passages, I have decided after consultation with Professor Shingu to translate the Japanese first person pronoun watashi as ""I"", but to use the third person form of the verb with it (e.g. ""I is an other.""). In so doing, I hope to convey a peculiarity of the Japanese of the original text. Verbs in Japanese do not conjugate for person, and there are no articles, so that both ""I am an other"", for example, and ""the `I' is an other"" would be expressed in exactly the same way: Watashi wa hitori no tasha de aru. Throughout the book, Professor Shingu talks about watashi (""I"") in discussing the vicissitudes of the Lacanian subject, and in Japanese, these passages not only read as natural ways of phrasing an objective consideration of ""the I"", but also as bearing quite intimately on the person of the author and/or the reader: ""I"". Inspired by the Rimbaudian ""I is an other"" quoted at the outset of Chapter V, we decided to compromise between the personal ""I"" (as opposed to the distancing ""the I"") and the objectifying use of the third person. We hope that this phraseology, even if it reads strangely in English, will convey something of the double import of the argument, which implicates the person of reader, writer, and translator even as it is, at the same time, a universal consideration of human subjectivity as a category.",3.00,4906502288,9784906502288,"May 2004 by Gakuju Shoin Publishers, LTD",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170373663l/51057.jpg

51066,The Iliad,Homer,"Composed between 800 and 700 B.C., the Iliad tells the story of the Achilles and other warriors in the tenth year of the Trojan War. The poem tells of the famous quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles and all that resulted, the extraordinary battlefield accomplishments of the world's most famous warriors and the final encounter between the Trojan Prince Hector and Achilles. The Iliad is the oldest and finest epic poem in Western culture. This book contains a new translation by Canadian Professor Ian Johnston. It has been translated from the original Greek into a modern English poetic form and was designed first and foremost for those who will be reading Homer's Iliad for the first time. Here, now, exists a new translation, faithful to Homer's eloquent poetic rendition yet fully understandable by the general reader. Richer Resources Publications is proud to present this new translation by Ian Johnston. For anyone who has ever wanted to read these classics, but were backed off by older English translations, this translation and its companion text, the Odyssey, serve as an introduction to two of the greatest classics of all time. The translation remains very close to Homer s text, yet the modern English idiom is extremely fluent and clear, with a rhythm well suited to the speaking voice. It's no accident that this translation has formed the basis for dramatic presentations of the Iliad in Philadelphia and Oxford and was chosen by Naxos Audiobooks for its full-length recording of the poem.",3.89,0977626903,9780977626908,January 1st 2006 by Richer Resources Publications (first published -800),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170373677l/51066._SY475_.jpg

51087,Knightfall: Knight Ridder and How the Erosion of Newspaper Journalism Is Putting Democracy at Risk,Davis Merritt,"""The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is clear: Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of the press. And yet a force seemingly even more powerful than the supreme law of the land threatens one of our nation's most precious guarantors of freedom.For more than two centuries, American newspapers have collected, organized, and disseminated the information that makes democracy possible. Occasional opponents of a free press have not been able to cripple newspapers and despite dire predictions, neither have radio, television, or the Internet. But greed can kill American newspapers, thus eliminating the crucial synergy between journalism and democracy.The reality that newspapers must remain financially viable has always dictated compromises between the competing missions of profit and public service. But in recent years the essential balancing of those missions has been replaced by a single-minded pursuit of profit. Whether the chosen method is scaling back of content, cutting corners to control costs, or dismantling the traditional wall separating the news and business departments, the result is the same: the watering down of newspaper journalism, which is the core of all American journalism. Without fundamental change in newspapers' corporate boardrooms, the flow of information that Americans need to govern themselves will dry up.In Knightfall, Davis ""Buzz"" Merritt, a 40-year newspaperman whose career runs parallel to the seismic shift in journalism's landscape, examines one notable exemplar of this growing trend, Knight Ridder, America's second-largest newspaper company with holdings including The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Miami Herald, the Detroit Free Press, and the Mercury News in San Jose.Merritt was a participant-observer in the 1974 marriage of two newspaper companies, a union that seemed made in heaven. Knight Newspapers' longstanding tradition of excellence in journalism coupled with Ridder Publications' business savvy should have created a unique company offering the best of both worlds.That it did not happen is a reflection of complex changes in American society and the realities of modern business pressures driven by Wall Street. There are no pure heroes or pure villains in this story; the players were doing what their training, background, and respective family histories urged them to do. But the story's outcome is ominous for American democracy. Merritt's personal accounts of the 30 years since the merger illustrate the degree to which what we know is being limited. Further, his portraits of key figures, analysis of societal changes, and dozens of interviews with others who were (and are) there reveal that not only is he on target, he is also not alone in his unsettling conclusions.A free press is a cornerstone of our democracy. The erosion of that foundation is a catastrophe in the making: the real possibility that the kind of journalism that gave rise to -- and preserves -- our democracy will disappear.""",3.40,0814408540,9780814408544,March 25th 2005 by AMACOM/American Management Association,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348881906l/51087.jpg

It provides a thorough, step-by-step approach to threads programming.Java's threading system is simple relative to other threading systems. In earlier versions of Java, this simplicity came with tradeoffs: some of the advanced features in other threading systems were not available in Java. J2SE 5.0 changes all that: it provides a large number of new thread-related classes that make the task of writing multithreaded programs that much easier.You'll learn where to use threads to increase efficiency, how to use them effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. This book discusses problems like deadlock, race conditions, and starvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden bugs.Java Threads, Third Edition, has been thoroughly expanded and revised.

Far from being a burden, however, these yearnings can themselves become a path to blessing, prompting questions and insights, resulting in new ways of being and believing. In this, his first book, Rabbi Kula takes us on an excursion into the depths of our desires, applying ancient Jewish tradition to seven of our most wonderful yearnings.

Volkman,"What if we shared planet Earth with other intelligent species?What if inter-species communication were really possible?Seek out some answers in Turtle Dolphin DreamsAn extremely unusual work of fiction in which three creatures, a turtle, a dolphin and a human link minds through dreams to bring a unique perception of the world. Most of the narration is by the Turtle, via the human and Dolphin's voice comes through both turtle and human, yet somehow this strange book hangs together and holds the reader's attention.Turtle wonders why humans identify so closely with our family and friends that their every action affects us, perhaps bringing deep joy or deep pain. Turtles view each life as an egg - overlapping and separate. They have developed the ability to link thoughts with others of their kind during the dream state of the annual hibernation. Somehow they recognise family and friend with whom they have no real contact during the wakeful summer, other than the brief mating season. Eggs are laid and left to hatch alone. The parents have no contact with the hatchlings until they mature and begin their first hibernation, when the dreaming begins.Dolphin cannot understand why adult humans are so serious while their children play. For dolphins it is the other way around. Youth is for learning everything needed for survival. Adulthood brings expertise, strength and time to play.""A pearl is a small thing, and yet it is as precious as any jewel. So is this little book."" --Robert Rich, Ph.D.""Turtle Dolphin Dreams is a wonderful little book.

51166,The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary,Simon Winchester,"From the best-selling author of The Professor and the Madman, The Map That Changed the World, and Krakatoa comes a truly wonderful celebration of the English language and of its unrivaled treasure house, the Oxford English Dictionary.  Writing with marvelous brio, Winchester first serves up a lightning history of the English language‚Äî""so vast, so sprawling, so wonderfully unwieldy""‚Äîand pays homage to the great dictionary makers, from ""the irredeemably famous"" Samuel Johnson to the ""short, pale, smug and boastful"" schoolmaster from New Hartford, Noah Webster. He then turns his unmatched talent for story-telling to the making of this most venerable of dictionaries. In this fast-paced narrative, the reader will discover lively portraits of such key figures as the brilliant but tubercular first editor Herbert Coleridge (grandson of the poet), the colorful, boisterous Frederick Furnivall (who left the project in a shambles), and James Augustus Henry Murray, who spent a half-century bringing the project to fruition. Winchester lovingly describes the nuts-and-bolts of dictionary making‚Äîhow unexpectedly tricky the dictionary entry for marzipan was, or how fraternity turned out so much longer and monkey so much more ancient than anticipated‚Äîand how bondmaid was left out completely, its slips found lurking under a pile of books long after the B-volume had gone to press. We visit the ugly corrugated iron structure that Murray grandly dubbed the Scriptorium‚Äîthe Scrippy or the Shed, as locals called it‚Äîand meet some of the legion of volunteers, from Fitzedward Hall, a bitter hermit obsessively devoted to the OED, to W. C. Minor, whose story is one ofdangerous madness, ineluctable sadness, and ultimate redemption. The Meaning of Everything is a scintillating account of the creation of the greatest monument ever erected to a living language. Simon Winchester's supple, vigorous prose illuminates this dauntingly ambitious project‚Äîa seventy-year odyssey to create the grandfather of all word-books, the world's unrivalled uber-dictionary.",3.99,0641715617,9780641715617,January 1st 2003 by Oxford University Press,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266459877l/51166.jpg

It is one of the only parks in the world to combine large wilderness areas with extensive private lands and a substantial residential population.

51289,"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists",Joel Best,"Does the number of children gunned down double each year? Does anorexia kill 150,000 young women annually? Do white males account for only a sixth of new workers? Startling statistics shape our thinking about social issues. But all too often, these numbers are wrong. This book is a lively guide to spotting bad statistics and learning to think critically about these influential numbers. Damned Lies and Statistics is essential reading for everyone who reads or listens to the news, for students, and for anyone who relies on statistical information to understand social problems.Joel Best bases his discussion on a wide assortment of intriguing contemporary issues that have garnered much recent media attention, including abortion, cyberporn, homelessness, the Million Man March, teen suicide, the U.S. census, and much more. Using examples from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other major newspapers and television programs, he unravels many fascinating examples of the use, misuse, and abuse of statistical information.In this book Best shows us exactly how and why bad statistics emerge, spread, and come to shape policy debates. He recommends specific ways to detect bad statistics, and shows how to think more critically about ""stat wars,"" or disputes over social statistics among various experts. Understanding this book does not require sophisticated mathematical knowledge; Best discusses the most basic and most easily understood forms of statistics, such as percentages, averages, and rates.This accessible book provides an alternative to either naively accepting the statistics we hear or cynically assuming that all numbers are meaningless. It shows how anyone can become a more intelligent, critical, and empowered consumer of the statistics that inundate both the social sciences and our media-saturated lives.",3.73,0520219783,9780520219786,May 8th 2001 by University of California Press (first published November 1st 1998),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388425809l/51289.jpg

51296,Oh the Glory of it All,Sean Wilsey,"""A memoir, at its heart, is written in order to figure out who you are,"" writes Sean Wilsey, and indeed, Oh the Glory of it All is compelling proof of his exhaustive personal quest. It's no surprise that as a kid in the '80s, Wilsey found similarities between his own life and his beloved Lord of the Rings and Star Wars--his journey was fraught with unnerving characters too.  Wilsey's father was a distant, wealthy man who used a helicopter when a moped would do and whose mandates included squeegeeing the stall after every shower. Much of Wilsey's youth was spent as subservient to, or rebelling against this imposing man. But the maternal figures in Wilsey's childhood were no less affecting. His mother, a San Francisco society butterfly turned globe-trotting peace promoter, seemed to behave only in extremes--either trying to convince young Sean to commit suicide with her, or arranging impromptu meetings with the Pope and Mikhail Gorbachev. And Dede, his demon of a stepmother, would have made the Brothers Grimm shiver.  As always with memoirs one must take expansive sections of recalled dialogue with a grain of salt, but Wilsey's short, unflinching sentences keep his outlandish story moving too quickly for much quibbling. In the end, Wilsey says, ""It took the unlikely combination of the three of them--mother, father, stepmother--to make me who I am."" It's a fairly basic conclusion after 479 pages of turning every stone, but it's also one that renders his story--more than shocking or glorious--human. --Brangien Davis",3.61,0143036912,9780143036913,April 25th 2006 by Penguin Books (first published May 19th 2005),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442699780l/51296._SY475_.jpg

51306,Mutual Aid,Pyotr Kropotkin,"In this cornerstone of modern liberal social theory, Peter Kropotkin states that the most effective human and animal communities are essentially cooperative, rather than competitive. Kropotkin based this classic on his observations of natural phenomena and history, forming a work of stunning and well-reasoned scholarship. Essential to the understanding of human evolution as well as social organization, it offers a powerful counterpoint to the tenets of Social Darwinism. It also cites persuasive evidence of human nature's innate compatibility with anarchist society.""Kropotkin's basic argument is correct,"" noted evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould. ""Struggle does occur in many modes, and some lead to cooperation among members of a species as the best pathway to advantage for individuals."" Anthropologist Ashley Montagu declared that ""Mutual Aid will never be any more out of date than will the Declaration of Independence. New facts may increasingly become available, but we can already see that they will serve largely to support Kropotkin's conclusion that 'in the ethical progress of man, mutual support‚Äînot mutual struggle‚Äîhas had the leading part.'"" Physician and author Alex Comfort asserted that ""Kropotkin profoundly influenced human biology by his theory of Mutual Aid. . . . He was one of the first systematic students of animal communities, and may be regarded as the founder of modern social ecology.""",4.23,1426414595,9781426414596,May 29th 2008 by BiblioLife (first published 1891),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348218981l/51306.jpg
51309,"Mutual Aid Groups, Vulnerable and Resilient Populations, and the Life Cycle",Alex Gitterman,"The contributors to this volume examine the role of mutual aid groups and social workers in helping members of oppressed, vulnerable, and resilient populations regain control over their lives. The chapters reveal the ways in which mutual aid processes help individuals overcome social and emotional trauma in contemporary society by reducing isolation, universalizing individual problems, and mitigating stigma. Using the life cycle as a framework the editors establish a theoretical model for practice and demonstrate how social workers as group leaders can foster the healing and empowering process of mutual aid. The contributors also consider the fundamentals of the mutual aid process, the institutional benefits of group service, and specific clinical examples of mutual aid groups.

51315,"Diet for a New America: How Your Food Choices Affect Your Health, Happiness and the Future of Life on Earth",John   Robbins,"From John Robbins, a new edition of the classic that awakened the conscience of a nation. Since the 1987 publication of Diet for a New America, beef consumption in the United States has fallen a remarkable 19%. While many forces are contributing to this dramatic shift in our habits, Diet for a New America is considered to be one of the most important. Diet for a New America is a startling examination of the food we currently buy and eat in the United States, and the astounding moral, economic, and emotional price we pay for it.In Section I, John Robbins takes an extraordinary look at our dependence on animals for food and the inhumane conditions under which these animals are raised. It becomes clear that the price we pay for our eating habits is measured in the suffering of animals, a suffering so extreme and needless that it disrupts our very place in the web of life.Section II challenges the belief that consuming meat is a requirement for health by pointing our the vastly increased rate of disease caused by pesticides, hormones, additives, and other chemicals now a routine part of our food production. The author shows us that the high health risk is unnecessary, and that the production, preparation, and consumption of food can once again be a healthy process.In Section III, Robbins looks at the global implications of a meat-based diet and concludes that the consumption of the resources necessary to produce meat is a major factor in our ecological crisis.Diet for a New America is the single most eloquent argument for a vegetarian lifestyle ever published. Eloquently, evocatively, and entertainingly written, it is a cant put down book guaranteed to amaze, infuriate, but ultimately educate and empower the reader.

51325,Modular Approaches to the Study of the Mind (Distinguished Graduate Research Lecture),Noam Chomsky,"The questions raised by Descartes more than three hundred years ago about the interrelationship of the body and mind remain largely unanswered today. These questions are at the core of the modern study of cognitive psychology, a field which attempts rational analysis of human disciplines ranging from philosophy and psychology through linguistics, artificial intelligence, neurology, and biology. In ""Modular Approaches to the Study of the Mind"" Noam Chomsky uses the historical background and nature of cognitive psychology to enable us better to understand several important problems of human thought and perception. This title offers the formal remarks of Chomsky in his San Diego State University Distinguished Graduate Research Lecture, including the give-and-take of a colloquium following the ecture. It is enhanced by a comprehensive bibliography of works by and about Chomsky, which in itself constitutes a profile of the vital intellectual milieu in which he has worked for over thirty years.

51328,Rules and Representations: Woodbridge Lecture 11,Noam Chomsky,"As Norbert Hornstein writes in his foreword, ""it underestimates Chomsky's impact in linguistics, philosophy, and psychology to describe it as immense."" In Rules and Representations, Noam Chomsky lays out many of the concepts that have made his approach to linguistics and human cognition so instrumental to our understanding of language.In this influential and controversial work Chomsky draws on philosophy, biology, and the study of the mind to consider the nature of human cognitive capacities, particularly as they are expressed in language. He arrives at his well-known position that there is a universal grammar, genetically determined, structured in the human mind, and common to all human languages. Aside from his examination of the various principles of the universal grammar ¬ó its ""rules and representations"" ¬ó Chomsky considers the biological basis of language capabilities and the possibility of studying mental structures and capacities in the manner of the natural sciences. Finally, he also explores whether there may be similar ""grammars"" of perception, art, human nature, scientific reasoning, and the unconscious.Based on Chomsky's lively 1978 Woodbridge Lectures, this edition, first published in 1980, contains revised versions of the original lectures and two new essays. It also includes an extensive foreword by Norbert Hornstein, discussing Chomsky's ideas and their wide-ranging impact.",3.86,0231048262,9780231048262,January 1st 1990 by Columbia University Press (first published 1980),https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/blank-133x176-8b769f39ba6687a82d2eef30bdf46977.jpg
51331,The Trials of Socrates: Six Classic Texts,Plato,"Lampooned in 406 B.C.E. in a blistering Aristophanic satire, Socrates was tried in 399 B.C.E. on a charge of corrupting the youth, convicted by a jury of about five hundred of his peers, and condemned to death. Glimpsed today through the extant writings of his contemporaries and near-contemporaries, he remains for us as compelling, enigmatic, and elusive a figure as Jesus or Buddha. Although present-day (like ancient Greek) opinion on ""the real Socrates"" diverges widely, six classic texts that any informed judgment of him must take into account appear together, for the first time, in this volume. Those of Plato and Xenophon appear in new, previously unpublished translations that combine accuracy, accessibility, and readability; that of Aristophanes' Clouds offers these same qualities in an unbowdlerized translation that captures brilliantly the bite of Aristophanes' wit. An Introduction to each text and judicious footnotes provide crucial background information and important cross-references.",3.73,,,"March 1st 2002 by Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385239903l/51331.jpg
51335,The Trial and Execution of Socrates: Sources and Controversies,Thomas C. Brickhouse,"Socrates is one of the most important yet enigmatic philosophers of all time; his fame has endured for centuries despite the fact that he never actually wrote anything. In 399 B.C.E., he was tried on the charge of impiety by the citizens of Athens, convicted by a jury, and sentenced to death (ordered to drink poison derived from hemlock). About these facts there is no disagreement. However, as the sources collected in this book and the scholarly essays that follow them show, several of even the most basic facts about these events were controversial in antiquity, and the questions persist today: How and why was Socrates brought to trial? Why did the jurors, members of the world's first democracy, find him guilty? When he was given an opportunity to escape execution, why did he refuse to do so and instead accept the punishment that he and his friends agreed was unjustly assigned to him? How exactly did Socrates die? Differences of opinion on these and other issues continue to arouse our curiosity and to challenge new generations of students and scholars.  The Trial and Execution of Socrates: Sources and Controversies is the first work to collect in one place all of the major ancient sources on Socrates' death--those of both his critics and his defenders--as well as recent scholarly views. Part I includes new translations of Plato's Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and the death scene from Phaedo, as well as other ancient sources that shed light on Socrates' trial and execution. Part II features some of the most influential recent scholarship on this historically momentous event with work by M. F. Burnyeat, Robert Parker, Mark L. McPherran, Thomas C. Brickhouse and Nicholas D. Smith, Richard Kraut, Christopher Gill, and Enid Bloch (whose essay is published here for the first time). Ideal for undergraduate surveys of ancient Greek philosophy and upper-level courses on Socrates and Socratic philosophy, this unique collection provides an unprecedented look into the many perplexing questions surrounding the trial and execution of this remarkable man.",3.82,0195119800,9780195119800,"December 27th 2001 by Oxford University Press, USA",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349072365l/51335.jpg

By covering the social, legal, and political realities surrounding famous trials, these series entries provide contextual overviews of the cases that have delineated concepts of law and justice in Western civilization. Both books benefit from the inclusion of archival drawings and reproductions and sidebar quotations from primary sources. Nardo traces the life and times of the ancient Athenian and shows the lasting influence of his ideas. Drawing on scholarly works such as I. F. Stone's The Trial of Socrates (Doubleday, 1989), this shorter volume introduces the story and legacy of the philosopher in a more accessible format. Although Rice's account of The Salem Witch Trials is accurate, the meaning of these events becomes obscured by the discussion of dozens of individuals and local figures. This examination of detail works better in texts such as Frances Hill's A Delusion of Satan (Doubleday, 1995), whereas clearer explanations of the hysteria for young people can be found in Laurel Van der Linde's The Devil in Salem Village (Millbrook, 1992) or Shirley Jackson's classic The Witchcraft of Salem Village (Random, 1963).",3.71,1560062673,9781560062677,May 1st 2002 by Lucent Books (first published June 1st 1996),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1298833608l/51337.jpg

This philosophical gadfly irritated the people of Athens, who tried him for corrupting their youth, and subsequently sentenced him to death for his ""crime.""In these four short works by Plato, we come to experience the full range of Socrates' penetrating mind. In the Euthyphro, Socrates searches after the truth about the nature of piety, even as he makes his way to Athens to answer an indictment leveled against him.The Apology recounts Socrates' attempt to defend himself against the charge of impiety. Once condemned, Socrates finds himself imprisoned to await death.The Crito captures his views on his relationship with the state and what each has a right to expect from the other.Finally, the Phaedo recalls the death scene as Socrates discusses the nature of the soul and immortality just before succumbing to the hemlock.",4.11,0879754966,9780879754969,September 1st 1988 by Prometheus Books (first published -400),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388700382l/51338.jpg

51360,From Ellis Island to JFK: New York's Two Great Waves of Immigration,Nancy Foner,"In the history, the very personality, of New York City, few events loom larger than the wave of immigration at the turn of the last century. Today a similar influx of new immigrants is transforming the city again. Better than one in three New Yorkers is now an immigrant. From Ellis Island to JFK is the first in-depth study that compares these two huge social changes. A key contribution of this book is Nancy Foner‚Äôs reassessment of the myths that have grown up around the earlier Jewish and Italian immigration‚Äîand that deeply color how today‚Äôs Asian, Latin American, and Caribbean arrivals are seen. Topic by topic, she reveals the often surprising realities of both immigrations. For example:Education: Most Jews, despite the myth, were not exceptional students at first, while many immigrant children today do remarkably well.Jobs: Immigrants of both eras came with more skills than is popularly supposed. Some today come off the plane with advanced degrees and capital to start new businesses.Neighborhoods: Ethnic enclaves are still with us but they‚Äôre no longer always slums‚Äîtoday‚Äôs new immigrants are reviving many neighborhoods and some are moving to middle-class suburbs.Gender: For married women a century ago, immigration often, surprisingly, meant less opportunity to work outside the home. Today, it‚Äôs just the opposite.Race: We see Jews and Italians as whites today, but to turn-of-the-century scholars they were members of different, alien races. Immigrants today appear more racially diverse‚Äîbut some (particularly Asians) may be changing the boundaries of current racial categories.Drawing on a wealth of historical and contemporary research and written in a lively and entertaining style, the book opens a new chapter in the study of immigration‚Äîand the story of the nation‚Äôs gateway city.",3.14,0300093217,9780300093216,January 11th 2002 by Yale University Press (first published 2000),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386920522l/51360.jpg

51362,The Survivors Club,Lisa Gardner,"One of today's most electrifying suspense novelists, ""New York Times"" bestselling author Lisa Gardner returns with a shattering thriller that dares to play on our deepest vulnerabilities. In this masterful new novel, the killer may very well be the one you sympathize with the most... THE FIRST RULE IS NEVER BLAME THE VICTIM.They survived what no woman should ever have to endure. Now these three women have the means, the opportunity, and the perfect motive. Are they trying to get away with murder--or is someone trying to make sure that this time they don't get away at all? The Survivors Club... that's what Jillian Hayes, Carol Rosen, and Meg Pesaturo call it. They won't consider themselves victims. They are survivors. They faced the blazing headlines and helped lead the investigation that caught the man who changed their lives forever. And now that Eddie Como, the College Hill rapist, has been murdered, shot down outside a packed courthouse moments before his trial was about to begin, all three women are openly ecstatic that he's dead. They are also the prime suspects in his murder. Detective Sergeant Roan Griffin knows all too well what can drive even the best people to cross the line. But he has never seen a case quite like this one. No one doubts that the murder of Eddie Como was a professional job, especially when the gunman is killed only blocks away from the shooting.But questions taunt Griffin: Who ordered the deaths of Eddie Como and his killer? Could three ordinary women have been driven to do the unthinkable? Had someone in the Survivors Club become a killer? Griffin seeks the truth--and finds himself confronted with the leader of the Survivors Club. Jillian Hayes is beautiful, successful, cool as ice, and she harbors a pain that mirrors Griffin's own. Did the horror of what happened to her push her over the thin and desperate line that separates survival and revenge? And if it did, could he blame her--or anyone in the Survivors Club? Then another woman is brutally attacked.Suddenly, with the city on the ragged edge of panic, gripped in a media and political firestorm of controversy, cover-up, and conspiracy, the hunt is on for a ruthless and cunning killer. For Griffin, this may well be the case that shatters his career. For Jillian, the harrowing nightmare is beginning all over again. Someone is out there. Someone who wants to finish what was started. Someone who wants to make sure that no one survives the Survivors Club.",4.07,0553589458,9780553589450,July 25th 2006 by Bantam Books (first published May 21st 2002),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1298426240l/51362.jpg
51363,The Rules of Attraction,Bret Easton Ellis,"From the bestselling author or Less Than Zero and American Psycho, The Rules of Attraction is a startlingly funny, kaleidoscopic novel about three students at a small, affluent liberal-arts college in New England with no plans for the future--or even the present--who become entangled in a curious romantic triangle. Bret Easton Ellis trains his incisive gaze on the kids at self-consciously bohemian Camden College and treats their sexual posturings and agonies with a mixture of acrid hilarity and compassion while exposing the moral vacuum at the center of their lives. Lauren changes boyfriends every time she changes majors and still pines for Victor who split for Europe months ago and she might or might not be writing anonymous love letter to ambivalent, hard-drinking Sean, a hopeless romantic who only has eyes for Lauren, even if he ends up in bed with half the campus, and Paul, Lauren's ex, forthrightly bisexual and whose passion masks a shrewd pragmatism. They waste time getting wasted, race from Thirsty Thursday Happy Hours to Dressed To Get Screwed parties to drinks at The Edge of the World or The Graveyard.

51367,Misquoting Jesus,Bart D. Ehrman,"When biblical scholar Bart Ehrman began to study the texts of the Bible in their original languages he was startled to discover the multitude of mistakes & intentional alterations that had been made by earlier translators. In Misquoting Jesus, he tells the story behind the mistakes & changes that ancient scribes made to the New Testament & shows the great impact they had upon the bibles used today. He frames his account with personal reflections on how his study of the Greek manuscripts made him abandon his once ultraconservative views of the Bible. Since the advent of the printing press & the accurate reproduction of texts, most people have assumed that when they read the New Testament they are reading an exact copy of Jesus' words or Paul's writings. Yet, for almost 1500 years these manuscripts were hand copied by scribes who were deeply influenced by the cultural, theological & political disputes of their day. Both mistakes & intentional changes abound in the surviving manuscripts, making the original words difficult to reconstruct. Ehrman reveals where & why these changes were made & how scholars go about reconstructing the original words of the New Testament as closely as possible. Ehrman makes the provocative case that many of our cherished biblical stories & widely held beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity & the divine origins of the Bible itself stem from both intentional & accidental alterations by scribes-- alterations that dramatically affected all subsequent versions of the Bible.",3.89,1428105824,9781428105829,2006 by Recorded Books (first published November 1st 2005),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1264014116l/51367.jpg
51368,"Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves",Sharon Begley,"Is it really possible to change the structure and function of the brain, and in so doing alter how we think and feel? The answer is a resounding yes. In late 2004, leading Western scientists joined the Dalai Lama at his home in Dharamsala, India, to address this very question‚Äìand in the process brought about a revolution in our understanding of the human mind. In this fascinating and far-reaching book, Wall Street Journal science writer Sharon Begley reports on how cutting-edge science and the ancient wisdom of Buddhism have come together to show how we all have the power to literally change our brains by changing our minds. These findings hold exciting implications for personal transformation.For decades, the conventional wisdom of neuroscience held that the hardware of the brain is fixed and immutable‚Äìthat we are stuck with what we were born with. As Begley shows, however, recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticity, a new science that investigates whether and how the brain can undergo wholesale change, reveal that the brain is capable not only of altering its structure but also of generating new neurons, even into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, and compensate for disability. Begley documents how this fundamental paradigm shift is transforming both our understanding of the human mind and our approach to deep-seated emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems. These breakthroughs show that it is possible to reset our happiness meter, regain the use of limbs disabled by stroke, train the mind to break cycles of depression and OCD, and reverse age-related changes in the brain. They also suggest that it is possible to teach and learn compassion, a key step in the Dalai Lama‚Äôs quest for a more peaceful world. But as we learn from studies performed on Buddhist monks, an important component in changing the brain is to tap the power of mind and, in particular, focused attention. This is the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness, a technique that has become popular in the West and that is immediately available to everyone. With her extraordinary gift for making science accessible, meaningful, and compelling, Sharon Begley illuminates a profound shift in our understanding of how the brain and the mind interact. This tremendously hopeful book takes us to the leading edge of a revolution in what it means to be human.",4.01,1400063906,9781400063901,January 2nd 2007 by Ballantine Books (first published 2007),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924556l/51368.jpg
51369,Change or Die: The Three Keys to Change at Work and in Life,Alan Deutschman,"""CHANGE OR DIE. What if you were given that choice? We're talking actual life and death now. Your own life and death. What if a well-informed, trusted authority figure said you had to make difficult and enduring changes in the way you think, feel, and act? If you didn't, your time would end soon‚Äîa lot sooner than it had to. Could you change when change mattered most?""This is the question Alan Deutschman poses in Change or Die, which began as a sensational cover story by the same title for Fast Company. Deutschman concludes that although we all have the ability to change our behavior, we rarely ever do. In fact, the odds are nine to one that, when faced with the dire need to change, we won't. From patients suffering from heart disease to repeat offenders in the criminal justice system to companies trapped in the mold of unsuccessful business practices, many of us could prevent ominous outcomes by simply changing our mindset.A powerful book with universal appeal, Change or Die deconstructs and debunks age-old myths about change and empowers us with three critical keys‚Äîrelate, repeat, and reframe‚Äîto help us make important positive changes in our lives. Explaining breakthrough research and progressive ideas from a wide selection of leaders in medicine, science, and business (including Dr. Dean Ornish, Mimi Silbert of the Delancey Street Foundation, Bill Gates, Daniel Boulud, and many others), Deutschman demonstrates how anyone can achieve lasting, revolutionary change.Change or Die is not about merely reorganizing or restructuring priorities; it's about challenging, inspiring, and helping all of us to make the dramatic transformations necessary in any aspect of life‚Äîchanges that are positive, attainable, and absolutely vital.",3.86,0060886897,9780060886899,January 2nd 2007 by Harper Business (first published December 26th 2006),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442423917l/51369._SX318_.jpg

51371,How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas,David Bornstein,"What business entrepreneurs are to the economy, social entrepreneurs are to social change. They are, writes David Bornstein, the driven, creative individuals who question the status quo, exploit new opportunities, refuse to give up--and remake the world for the better.  How to Change the World tells the fascinating stories of these remarkable individuals--many in the United States, others in countries from Brazil to Hungary--providing an In Search of Excellence for the nonprofit sector. In America, one man, J.B. Schramm, has helped thousands of low-income highschool students get into college. In South Africa, one woman, Veronica Khosa, developed a home-based care model for AIDS patients that changed government health policy. In Brazil, Fabio Rosa helped bring electricity to hundreds of thousands of remote rural residents. Another American, James Grant, is credited with saving 25 million lives by leading and 'marketing' a global campaign for immunization. Yet another, Bill Drayton, created a pioneering foundation, Ashoka, that has funded and supported these social entrepreneurs and over a thousand like them, leveraging the power of their ideasacross the globe.  These extraordinary stories highlight a massive transformation that is going largely unreported by the media: Around the world, the fastest-growing segment of society is the nonprofit sector, as millions of ordinary people--social entrepreneurs--are increasingly stepping in to solve theproblems where governments and bureaucracies have failed.

In order to fulfill its revolutionary potential, feminist theory must begin by consciously transforming its own definition to encompass the lives and ideas of women on the margin.

51391,"What Lies Beneath: Katrina, Race, and the State of the Nation",The South End Press Collective,"With an eye toward community organizing and radical scholarship, What Lies Beneath, is both a people's history and a collective vision for the future of New Orleans.In August 2005, thousands of New Orleans residents‚Äîoverwhelmingly poor, largely people of color, the majority black‚Äîwere left to face one of the worst ‚Äúnatural‚Äù disasters in US history on their own. They were left to die in prisons, in nursing homes, and on the street. Survivors were criminalized as ‚Äúlooters‚Äù for struggling to obtain food, water, diapers, medicine, and other essentials of life that no one else could or would provide. As Katrina‚Äôs waters receded and the body count soared, an ugly truth (re)surfaced: The lives of those who are poor, who are vulnerable, and who are not white are not valued by the US government. ¬† While commentators across the political spectrum, celebrities, and other observers expressed outrage that the US government would let this happen to Americans‚Äîeven ‚Äúthose Americans‚Äù‚Äîmillions outside of New Orleans live without adequate health insurance; clean air and water; decent education, housing, nutrition, health care, and work; and freedom from police brutality and state repression. And thousands are deported, displaced, and dying in prisons and illegal wars from coast to coast, gulf to gulf. Short and accessible, this anthology, featuring such voices as Common Ground, SONG, INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence, Suheir Hammad, Jordan Flaherty, Joy James and Ross Gelbspan, takes readers beyond the Superdome. It explores the complexity of this turning point in US history as representative of the nation‚Äôs direction and priorities. ‚ÄúHere, finally, is clear-eyed and fascinating analysis of what Hurricane Katrina has to teach us about politics, power, human connection, and working for justice. What Lies Beneath is crucial reading‚Äîan organizer‚Äôs handbook for the 21st century.‚Äù‚ÄîHon. Barbara Smith, co-founder, Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, Member, City Council, Albany, New York ‚ÄúWhat Lies Beneath is a book that will keep alive the memory of one of the most dramatic and terrible events of the new millennium‚Äîthe catastrophe of the Katrina hurricane and its aftermath.‚Ä¶ At the center of story are the unavoidable issues of race, class, and the shameful callousness of officialdom. The book will keep us thinking for a long time about what happened, why it happened, and provoke us to examine honestly the nature of the society in which we live.‚Äù‚ÄîHoward Zinn, author of A People's History of the United States‚ÄúWhat Lies Beneath reveals how ‚Äònatural‚Äô disasters like Katrina are increasingly man-made and caused by corporate greed, how those who have no role in creating climate chaos bear its worst burden, and how those involved in the crime of climate catastrophes use the disasters they have created to dispossess the poor, women, and people of color in the name of a ‚Äòcleanup.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄîVandana Shiva, author of Earth Democracy‚ÄúWhat Lies Beneath is a work of fury spawned not by the inchoate forces of nature, but by activists, poets, organizers, and scholars. This brilliant little book is a written response to the forces of state, corporate, and media power which converged to isolate, demonize, destroy, and finally forget those many black and poor people who found themselves bitterly alone in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.‚Äù‚ÄîMumia Abu-Jamal, author of We Want Freedom",3.95,0896087670,9780896087675,February 1st 2007 by South End Press,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328770094l/51391.jpg

51395,"Soul Sister: Women, Friendship, And Fulfillment",bell hooks,"Sisterhood is powerful, yet so is competition and antagonism between women. In Soul Sister bell hooks asks why, now that feminism has begun to make inroads in so many spheres, women seem more hostile and less understanding of each other; and what, if anything, feminists should do about this crisis.In Soul Sister, hooks considers the causes for increased tension between women including widening economic gaps, persistent racism, and homophobia and shows how the media plays a role in creating divisions between women. She also suggests strategies for reconciliation, and proposes ways to increase harmony and acceptance.Like most of hooks' more recent titles on love and relationships, Soul Sister is conversational, direct, powerful, spiritual and written for a multiracial audience.

51398,Teaching Critical Thinking: Practical Wisdom,bell hooks," In Teaching Critical Thinking, renowned cultural critic and progressive educator bell hooks addresses some of the most compelling issues facing teachers in and out of the classroom today.In a series of short, accessible, and enlightening essays, hooks explores the confounding and sometimes controversial topics that teachers and students have urged her to address since the publication of the previous best-selling volumes in her Teaching series, Teaching to Transgress and Teaching Community. The issues are varied and broad, from whether meaningful teaching can take place in a large classroom setting to confronting issues of self-esteem. One professor, for example, asked how black female professors can maintain positive authority in a classroom without being seen through the lens of negative racist, sexist stereotypes. One teacher asked how to handle tears in the classroom, while another wanted to know how to use humor as a tool for learning.Addressing questions of race, gender, and class in this work, hooks discusses the complex balance that allows us to teach, value, and learn from works written by racist and sexist authors. Highlighting the importance of reading, she insists on the primacy of free speech, a democratic education of literacy. Throughout these essays, she celebrates the transformative power of critical thinking. This is provocative, powerful, and joyful intellectual work. It is a must read for anyone who is at all interested in education today.",4.28,0415968208,9780415968201,September 1st 2007 by Routledge (first published January 1st 2007),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348807161l/51398.jpg

51400,Space,bell hooks,"What does it mean to call a place home? Who is allowed to become a member of a community? When can we say that we truly belong?These are some of the questions of place and belonging that renowned cultural critic bell hooks examines in her new book, Belonging: A Culture of Place. Traversing past and present, Belonging charts a cyclical journey in which hooks moves from place to place, from country to city and back again, only to end where she began--her old Kentucky home.hooks has written provocatively about race, gender, and class; and in this book she turns her attention to focus on issues of land and land ownership. Reflecting on the fact that 90% of all black people lived in the agrarian South before mass migration to northern cities in the early 1900s, she writes about black farmers, about black folks who have been committed both in the past and in the present to local food production, to being organic, and to finding solace in nature. Naturally, it would be impossible to contemplate these issues without thinking about the politics of race and class. Reflecting on the racism that continues to find expression in the world of real estate, she writes about segregation in housing and economic racialized zoning. In these critical essays, hooks finds surprising connections that link of the environment and sustainability to the politics of race and class that reach far beyond Kentucky.With characteristic insight and honesty, Belonging offers a remarkable vision of a world where all people--wherever they may call home--can live fully and well, where everyone can belong.",4.12,0415968151,9780415968157,October 21st 2008 by Routledge (first published October 24th 2004),https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/blank-133x176-8b769f39ba6687a82d2eef30bdf46977.jpg

51433,The Rebels of Ireland,Edward Rutherfurd,"The reigning master of grand historical fiction returns with the stirring conclusion to his bestselling Dublin Saga.¬†¬†The Princes of Ireland, the first volume of Edward Rutherfurd‚Äôs magisterial epic of Irish history, ended with the disastrous Irish revolt of 1534 and the disappearance of the sacred Staff of Saint Patrick. The Rebels of Ireland opens with an Ireland transformed; plantation, the final step in the centuries-long English conquest of Ireland, is the order of the day, and the subjugation of the native Irish Catholic population has begun in earnest. Edward Rutherfurd brings history to life through the tales of families whose fates rise and fall in each generation: Brothers who must choose between fidelity to their ancient faith or the security of their families; a wife whose passion for a charismatic Irish chieftain threatens her comfortable marriage to a prosperous merchant; a young scholar whose secret rebel sympathies are put to the test; men who risk their lives and their children‚Äôs fortunes in the tragic pursuit of freedom, and those determined to root them out forever. Rutherfurd spins the saga of Ireland‚Äôs 400-year path to independence in all its drama, tragedy, and glory through the stories of people from all strata of society--Protestant and Catholic, rich and poor, conniving and heroic. ¬†His richly detailed narrative brings to life watershed moments and events, from the time of plantation settlements to the ‚ÄúFlight of the Earls,‚Äù when the native aristocracy fled the island, to Cromwell‚Äôs suppression of the population and the imposition of the harsh anti-Catholic penal laws. He describes the hardships of ordinary people and the romantic, doomed attempt to overthrow the Protestant oppressors, which ended in defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and the departure of the ‚ÄúWild Geese.‚Äù In vivid tones Rutherfurd re-creates Grattan‚Äôs Parliament, Wolfe Tone's attempted French invasion of 1798, the tragic rising of Robert Emmet, the Catholic campaign of Daniel O‚ÄôConnell, the catastrophic famine, the mass migration to America, and the glorious Irish Renaissance of Yeats and Joyce. And through the eyes of his characters, he captures the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the great Irish nationalists and the birth of an Ireland free of all ties to England. ¬†A tale of fierce battles, hot-blooded romances, and family and political intrigues, The Rebels of Ireland brings the story begun in The Princes of Ireland to a stunning conclusion.",4.10,0345472365,9780345472366,February 27th 2007 by Ballantine Books (first published February 1st 2004),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388283043l/51433.jpg
51434,Soul Rebels: The Rastafari,William F. Lewis,". . . a cult, a deviant subculture, a revolutionary movement . . . these descriptions have been commonly used in the past to identify the Rastafari, a group perhaps best known to North American readers for their gift of reggae music to the world. With both compassion and a sharp sense of reality, anthropologist William Lewis suggests alternative perspectives and reviews existing social theories as he reports on the diverse world of the ganga- smoking Rastafari culture. He carefully examines this culture in its confrontations with the law, its growing ambivalence about itself as well as the continued conflict between many Rasta and contemporary middle-class values. Characterized by rich ethnographic detail, an engaging writing style, and thoughtful commentary, Soul Rebels uncovers the complex inner workings of the Rasta movement and offers a critical analysis of the meaning of Rastafari commitment and struggles. Soul Rebels offers a solid historical overview of the movement, an excellent picture of diversity within the faith, fair and accurate discussions of sexism among the Rasta, engaging life history material, and rich descriptions of what actually goes on in a ""reasoning"" session.

His case has generated more controversy and received more attention, both national and international, than that of any other inmate currently under sentence of death in the United States of America.Mumia Abu Jamal, black, was convicted and sentenced to death in July 1982 for the murder of white police officer Daniel Faulkner on December 9, 1981. He has steadfastly maintained his innocence. Since the trial, those advocating his release or retrial have contested the validity of much of the evidence used to obtain his conviction. These accusations have been countered by members of the law enforcement community and their supporters, who have agitated for Abu-Jamal's execution while maintaining that the trial was unbiased.Based on its review of the trial transcript and other original documents, human rights organization Amnesty International believes that the interests of justice would best be served by the granting of a new trial to Mumia Abu-Jamal.

51452,Executing Justice: An Inside Account of the Case of Mumia Abu-Jamal,Daniel R. Williams,"Mumia Abu-Jamal is an award-winning journalist and author of three well-received books and many essays. He is also a death-row inmate, awaiting execution in Pennsylvania for allegedly killing a police officer in 1981. For many around the world, he is an inspired leader and the centerpiece to a revived progressive movement critical of our justice system and escalating global economic inequities. For others, he is a cold-blooded killer who has duped millions, including a vast array of Hollywood celebrities, writers, intellectuals and world political leaders, into believing that he is a political prisoner falsely imprisoned. Whatever the outlook, he and his case have become a flashpoint in the ever-raging debate over capital punishment in this country and a symbol of what is wrong with our criminal justice system.Here, for the first time, the story of Mumia Abu-Jamal's trial and his struggle to gain his freedom has been told. Executing Justice takes us inside the courtroom where a fierce and skilled prosecutor wove a damning narrative of a young black radical who brutally murdered a young white police officer in the red-light district of Philadelphia, and then later boasted about the killing. It was, the prosecutor said, the strongest murder case he's ever tried. Daniel R. Williams, defense lawyer and chief legal strategist for Mumia Abu-Jamal, invites us to ask: why has this case engendered such enormous attention and aroused the passions of people worldwide?Executing Justice is the story of how the death penalty really works in this country‚Äînot from the perspective of appellate judges, academics, or politicians who pontificate about the pros and cons of capital punishment, but from ground zero, within the pit of the courtroom where the war over life and death is fought. It is also a story of one of the most remarkable trials in our history. Above all, Executing Justice is an honest, at times confessional, book that seeks not to preach, but to raise questions about what we expect from our legal system and the depth of our commitment to capital punishment as a form of executing justice.",3.72,0312283172,9780312283179,May 20th 2002 by St. Martin's Griffin (first published 2001),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312056460l/51452.jpg
51456,The Politics of Food,Brigitte Nerlich,"Is shopping for food really a political act?Why is it that, in a world with enough food for everyone, more people than ever go hungry?Why did the French resistance against genetically modified foods become a fight against McDonalds?Why did the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK become a problem for consumers?Capable of connecting human bodies to abstract nations, and techno-science to moral concerns, food has become one of the most contested fields of our time. It is high on the political agenda throughout the world. With disease, contamination, famine, hunger and imbalanced food markets all unfortunate realities, a book that interrogates the politics of food is long overdue.From the BSE outbreak in the 1990s through to cultural taboos and the genetic modification of produce and livestock, this timely book raises provocative questions about how we relate to food in the 21st century. Recent food scandals and genetically modified organism controversies have shattered the idea that 'food is food' as we have always known it, and exposed fundamental dilemmas related to risk and control. Taking as its starting point the premise that food is politicized in arenas not commonly thought of as political, The Politics of Food explores issues surrounding the development of global food markets in underdeveloped nations and addresses recent events that have had a profound impact on how consumers feel about what they eat. The epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease that swept through the UK in 2001 spawned a series of questions concerning the real costs of cheap food. What lessons have been learned? And how are food choices linked to the politics of food markets?With globalization, food has increasingly become entangled in webs of political significance. Through ethnographic case studies, this book reveals how food has come to serve a key role in political resistance, grassroots activism and nation-building. Anyone interested in globalization, food safety, or what food choices say about food politics will find this book essential reading.",3.20,1859738486,9781859738481,December 10th 2004 by Bloomsbury Academic,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364258397l/51456.jpg
51459,Cooking Lessons: The Politics of Gender and Food,Sherrie A. Inness,"Meatloaf, fried chicken, Jell-O, cake-because foods are so very common, we rarely think about them much in depth. The authors of Cooking Lessons however, believe that food is deserving of our critical scrutiny and that such analysis yields many important lessons about American society and its values. This book explores the relationship between food and gender. Contributors draw from diverse sources, both contemporary and historical, and look at women from various cultural backgrounds, including Hispanic, traditional southern White, and African American. Each chapter focuses on a certain food, teasing out its cultural meanings and showing its effect on women's identity and lives. For example, food has often offered women a traditional way to gain power and influence in their households and larger communities. For women without access to other forms of creative expression, preparing a superior cake or batch of fried chicken was a traditional way to display their talent in an acceptable venue. On the other hand, foods and the stereotypes attached to them have also been used to keep women (and men, too) from different races, ethnicities, and social classes in their place.",3.67,0742515745,9780742515741,July 30th 2001 by Rowman & Littlefield Publishers (first published January 1st 2001),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348393740l/51459.jpg

51466,"Aspects of the Novel, and Related Writings",E.M. Forster,"E.M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel is an innovative and effusive treatise on a literary form that, at the time of publication, had only recently begun to enjoy serious academic consideration. This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction by Oliver Stallybrass, and features a new preface by Frank Kermode.First given as a series of lectures at Cambridge University, Aspects of the Novel is Forster's analysis of this great literary form. Here he rejects the 'pseudoscholarship' of historical criticism - 'that great demon of chronology' - that considers writers in terms of the period in which they wrote and instead asks us to imagine the great novelists working together in a single room. He discusses aspects of people, plot, fantasy and rhythm, making illuminating comparisons between novelists such as Proust and James, Dickens and Thackeray, Eliot and Dostoyevsky - the features shared by their books and the ways in which they differ. Written in a wonderfully engaging and conversational manner, this penetrating work of criticism is full of Forster's habitual irreverence, wit and wisdom.In his new introduction, Frank Kermode discusses the ways in which Forster's perspective as a novelist inspired his lectures. This edition also includes the original introduction by Oliver Stallybrass, a chronology, further reading and appendices.E. M. Forster (1879-1970) was a noted English author and critic and a member of the Bloomsbury group. His first novel, Where Angels Fear To Tread appeared in 1905. The Longest Journey appeared in 1907, followed by A Room With A View (1908), based partly on the material from extended holidays in Italy with his mother. Howards End (1910) was a story that centered on an English country house and dealt with the clash between two families, one interested in art and literature, the other only in business. Maurice was revised several times during his life, and finally published posthumously in 1971.If you enjoyed Aspects of the Novel, you might like Forster's A Room with a View, also available in Penguin Classics.",3.81,0713157690,9780713157697,1974 by Arnold (first published 1927),https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/blank-133x176-8b769f39ba6687a82d2eef30bdf46977.jpg

Four scientific essays--including one by Stephen Jay Gould--elucidate Victorian conceptions of atavism, multiple-personality disorder, narcotics addiction, and sexual aberration. Judith R. Walkowitz and Walter Houghton consider the implications of Victorian moral conformity and political disunity for society at large. Performance Adaptations addresses--in writings by C. Alex Pinkston, Jr., Charles King, and Scott Allen Nollen--the many ways in which Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has been dramatized over more than a century and explores its status as a perpetually effective vehicle for changing psychological and social concerns. A checklist of major performance adaptions is provided, along with a sampler of publicity photos. Criticism includes essays by G. K. Chesterton, Vladimir Nabokov, Peter K. Garrett, Patrick Brantlinger, and Katherine Linehan that center on the tale's major themes of morality, allegory, and self-alienation. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.",3.83,0393974650,9780393974652,January 7th 2003 by W. W.

51503,Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Other Tales,Robert Louis Stevenson,"Robert Louis Stevenson's short novel, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,  first published in 1886, became an instant classic, a Gothic horror originating in a feverish nightmare whose hallucinatory setting in the back streets of London gripped a nation mesmerized by crime and violence. Its revelatory ending is one of the most original and thrilling in English Literature. This new edition of Stevenson's most famous work includes three additional short stories, two short essays, and extracts from contemporary writing on psychological disorders. The introduction considers the reasons for the book's popularity, the double, and psychoanalytic interpretations, as well as crime, sex, class, and urbanism in the 1880s. Appendixes provide contextual historical material by Henry Maudsley, Frederic Myers, and W.T. Stead.

The present volume has been compiled from notes taken down at the time by three of the students: Rush Rhees, Yorick Smythies & James Taylor. They've been supplemented by notes of conversations on Freud (to whom reference was made in the course on esthetics) between him & Rush Rhees & by notes of some lectures on religious belief. As very little is known of his views on these subjects from his published works, these notes should be of considerable interest to students of contemporary philosophy.

It is the story of a woman who is convinced, and, astonishingly, will ultimately convince the reader as well, that she is the only person left on earth. Presumably she is mad. And yet so appealing is her character, and so witty and seductive her narrative voice, that we will follow her hypnotically as she unloads the intellectual baggage of a lifetime in a series of irreverent meditations on everything and everybody from Brahms to sex to Heidegger to Helen of Troy. And as she contemplates aspects of the troubled past which have brought her to her present state, so too will her drama become one of the few certifiably original fictions of our time.",3.97,1564782115,9781564782113,May 1st 1988 by Dalkey Archive Press,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347696167l/51506.jpg
51509,Republic of Signs: Liberal Theory and American Popular Culture,Anne Norton,"Norton examines the enactment of liberal ideas in popular culture; in the possessions of ordinary people and the habits of everyday life. She sees liberalism as the common sense of the American people: a set of conventions unconsciously adhered to, a set of principles silently taken for granted. The author ranges over a wide expanse of popular activities (e.g. wrestling, roller derby, lotteries, shopping sprees, and dining out), as well as conventional political topics (e.g., the Constitution, presidency, news media, and centrality of law). Yet the argument is pointed and probling, never shallow or superficial. Fred and Wilma Flintstone are as vital to the republic as Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.""In discussions that range from the Constitution and the presidency to money and shopping, voting, lotteries, and survey research, Norton discerns and imaginatively invents possibilities that exceed recognized actualities and already approved opportunities.""‚ÄîRichard E.

The posthumous publication of Gethin's collection of essays Misery's Virtues Whet-Stone (1699) was sponsored by her mother; subsequently Norton invoked her maternal grief as the grounds for publishing her own essay collection The Applause of Virtue to which is appended Memento Mori: Or, Meditations on Death (1705). These essay collections unconventionally privilege a female perspective on traditional topics such as friendship, love, marriage and death. Accordingly, they hold an intrinsic interest for their gendered point of view, as well as an extrinsic interest for their conditions of production. Norton's final published work, A Miscellany of Poems, Compos'd and work'd with a Needle, on the Backs and Seats &c. Of several Chairs and Stools (1714), further reprises the theme of maternal grief as the justification for women's writing.

Drawing from sources as diverse as foundational myths from Sarah in the bible, Marat in his death bath, and thinkers like Hegel and Foucault, Norton reinterprets the relationship between word and flesh and places it in historical context.

51523,Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans,Joyce Appleby,"Born after the Revolution, the first generation of Americans inherited a truly new world--and, with it, the task of working out the terms of Independence. Anyone who started a business, marketed a new invention, ran for office, formed an association, or wrote for publication was helping to fashion the world's first liberal society. These are the people we encounter in Inheriting the Revolution, a vibrant tapestry of the lives, callings, decisions, desires, and reflections of those Americans who turned the new abstractions of democracy, the nation, and free enterprise into contested realities. Through data gathered on thousands of people, as well as hundreds of memoirs and autobiographies, Joyce Appleby tells myriad intersecting stories of how Americans born between 1776 and 1830 reinvented themselves and their society in politics, economics, reform, religion, and culture. They also had to grapple with the new distinction of free and slave labor, with all its divisive social entailments; the rout of Enlightenment rationality by the warm passions of religious awakening; the explosion of small business opportunities for young people eager to break out of their parents' colonial cocoon. Few in the nation escaped the transforming intrusiveness of these changes. Working these experiences into a vivid picture of American cultural renovation, Appleby crafts an extraordinary--and deeply affecting--account of how the first generation established its own culture, its own nation, its own identity.The passage of social responsibility from one generation to another is always a fascinating interplay of the inherited and the novel; this book shows how, in the early nineteenth century, the very idea of generations resonated with new meaning in the United States.",3.60,0674006631,9780674006638,September 15th 2001 by Belknap Press of Harvard University Press (first published 2000),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1399589967l/51523.jpg

In that capacity, he has listened to people talk about their lives and the limitless ways that they have found to be unhappy. He is also a parent twice bereaved. In one thirteen-month period, he lost his eldest son to suicide, his youngest to leukemia. Out of a lifetime of experience, Livingston has extracted thirty bedrock truths: We are what we do. Any relationship is under the control of the person who cares the least. The perfect is the enemy of the good. Only bad things happen quickly. Forgiveness is a form of letting go, but they are not the same thing. The statute of limitations has expired on most of our childhood traumas. Livingston illuminates these and twenty-four others in perfectly calibrated essays, many of which emphasize our closest relationships and the things that we do to impede or enhance them. These writings underscore that ""we are what we do,"" and that while there may be no escaping who we are, we have the capacity to face loss, misfortune, and regret, and to move beyond them.",3.86,1569244197,9781569244197,November 9th 2004 by Da Capo Lifelong Books (first published 2004),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630494166l/51526._SY475_.jpg

51541,Death at an Early Age,Jonathan Kozol,"In this National Book Award-winning book, Kozol unflinchingly exposes the disturbing ""destruction of hearts and minds in the Boston public school.""

51544,The Shame of the Nation,Jonathan Kozol,"The nation needs to be confronted with the crime that we're committing and the promises we are betraying. This is a book about betrayal of the young, who have no power to defend themselves. It is not intended to make readers comfortable."" Over the past several years, Jonathan Kozol has visited nearly 60 public schools. Virtually everywhere, he finds that conditions have grown worse for inner-city children in the 15 years since federal courts began dismantling the landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. First, a state of nearly absolute apartheid now prevails in thousands of our schools. The segregation of black children has reverted to a level that the nation has not seen since 1968. Few of the students in these schools know white children any longer. Second, a protomilitary form of discipline has now emerged, modeled on stick-and-carrot methods of behavioral control traditionally used in prisons but targeted exclusively at black and Hispanic children. And third, as high-stakes testing takes on pathological and punitive dimensions, liberal education in our inner-city schools has been increasingly replaced by culturally barren and robotic methods of instruction that would be rejected out of hand by schools that serve the mainstream of society. Filled with the passionate voices of children and their teachers and some of the most revered and trusted leaders in the black community, ""The Shame of the Nation"" is a triumph of firsthand reporting that pays tribute to those undefeated educators who persist against the odds, but directly challenges the chilling practices now being forced upon our urban systems by the Bush administration. In their place, Kozol offers a humane, dramatic challenge to our nation to fulfill at last the promise made some 50 years ago to all our youngest citizens. From ""The Shame of the Nation"" ""I went to Washington to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations,"" the president said in his campaign for reelection in September 2004. ""It's working. It's making a difference."" It is one of those deadly lies, which, by sheer repetition, is at length accepted by large numbers of Americans as, perhaps, a rough approximation of the truth. But it is not the truth, and it is not an innocent misstatement of the facts. It is a devious appeasement of the heartache of the parents of the poor and, if it is not forcefully resisted and denounced, it is going to lead our nation even further in a perilous direction.Also available as a Random House AudioBook and an eBook""From the Hardcover edition.",4.14,073946552X,9780739465523,2005 by Crown Publishers,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170381055l/51544.jpg

Schor,"Marketing targeted at kids is virtually everywhere -- in classrooms and textbooks, on the Internet, even at Girl Scout meetings, slumber parties, and the playground. Product placement and other innovations have introduced more subtle advertising to movies and television. Drawing on her own survey research and unprecedented access to the advertising industry, Juliet B. Schor, New York Times bestselling author of The Overworked American, examines how marketing efforts of vast size, scope, and effectiveness have created ""commercialized children."" Ads and their messages about sex, drugs, and food affect not just what children want to buy, but who they think they are. In this groundbreaking and crucial book, Schor looks at the consequences of the commercialization of childhood and provides guidelines for parents and teachers. What is at stake is the emotional and social well-being of our children.

51558,Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society,Michael K. Brown,"White Americans, abetted by neo-conservative writers of all hues, generally believe that racial discrimination is a thing of the past and that any racial inequalities that undeniably persist‚Äîin wages, family income, access to housing or health care‚Äîcan be attributed to African Americans' cultural and individual failures. If the experience of most black Americans says otherwise, an explanation has been sorely lacking‚Äîor obscured by the passions the issue provokes. At long last offering a cool, clear, and informed perspective on the subject, this book brings together a team of highly respected sociologists, political scientists, economists, criminologists, and legal scholars to scrutinize the logic and evidence behind the widely held belief in a color-blind society‚Äîand to provide an alternative explanation for continued racial inequality in the United States. While not denying the economic advances of black Americans since the 1960s, Whitewashing Race draws on new and compelling research to demonstrate the persistence of racism and the effects of organized racial advantage across many institutions in American society‚Äîincluding the labor market, the welfare state, the criminal justice system, and schools and universities.

51581,The Environmental Unconscious in the Fiction of Don Delillo,Elise Martucci,"This book presents an ecocritical reading of DeLillo's novels in an attempt to mediate between the seemingly incompatible influences of postmodernism and environmentalism. Martucci argues that although DeLillo is responding to and engaging with a postmodern culture of simulacra and simulation, his novels do not reflect a postmodernist theory of the ""end of nature."" Rather, his fiction emphasizes the lasting significance of the natural world and alerts us to the dangers of destroying it. In order to support this argument, Martucci examines DeLillo's novels in the context of traditional American literary representations of the environment, especially through the lens of Leo Marx's discussion of the conflict between technology and nature found in traditional American literature. She demonstrate that DeLillo's fiction explores the way in which new technologies alter perceptions and mediate reality to a further extent than earlier technologies; however, she argues that he keeps the material world at the forefront of his novels, thereby illuminating the environmental implications of these technologies. Through close readings of Americana, The Names, White Noise, and Underworld, and discussions of postmodernist and ecocritical theories, this project engages with current criticism of DeLillo, postmodernist fiction, and environmental criticism.",2.00,,,June 25th 2007 by Routledge,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347462236l/51581.jpg

Thomas Couser,"My primary concern is with the ethics of representing vulnerable subjects--persons who are liable to exposure by someone with whom they are involved in an intimate or trust-based relationship, unable to represent themselves in writing, or unable to offer meaningful consent to their representation by someone else.... Of primary importance is intimate life writing--that done within families or couples, close relationships, or quasi-professional relationships that involve trust--rather than conventional biography, which can be written by a stranger. The closer the relationship between writer and subject, the greater the vulnerability or dependency of the subject, the higher the ethical stakes, and the more urgent the need for ethical scrutiny.--from the PrefaceVulnerable Subjects explores a range of life-writing scenarios-from the celebrity to the ethnographic--and a number of life-writing genres from parental memoir to literary case studies by Oliver Sacks. G. Thomas Couser addresses complex contemporary issues; he investigates the role of disability in narratives of euthanasia and explores the implications of the Human Genome Project for life-writing practices in any age when many regard DNA as a code that scripts lives and shapes identity.

51612,Until the End,Harold Coyle,"James and Kevin Bannon, the two brothers introduced in Look Away, continue to serve on opposing sides. James with the 4th Virginia Regiment and Kevin commanding a company in the 4th New Jersey. In their struggle to survive, their fear that one day they'd encounter each other on the battlefield was finally realized during the terrible conclusion of the third day at Gettysburg. Now, in the bloody aftermath of that titanic struggle, James and Kevin continue their brutal and bloody experience of war. From the dark and inconclusive days of the Mine Run Campaign in the fall of 1863, through the terrible ""Forty Days"" that took the two armies from the Wilderness to the gates of Petersburg, the brothers soldier on. James, with Lee's Army, watches as it slowly bleeds itself to death defending a state he has come to love. Kevin, living with the realization that James is serving in the army his nation is committed to destroy, marches with the Army of the Potomac as he alternates between a desperate search for James and his terrible burden as an officer, leading men he has grown to love into bloody battles that will claim their lives.",3.99,0671890174,9780671890179,March 1st 1997 by Pocket Books (first published September 12th 1996),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389406376l/51612.jpg
51616,"Puccini's ""Turandot"": The End of the Great Tradition",William Ashbrook,"Unfinished at Puccini's death in 1924, Turandot was not only his most ambitious work, but it became the last Italian opera to enter the international repertory. In this colorful study two renowned music scholars demonstrate that this work, despite the modern climate in which it was written, was a fitting finale for the centuries-old Great Tradition of Italian opera. Here they provide concrete instances of how a listener might encounter the dramatic and musical structures of Turandot in light of the Italian melodramma, and firmly establish Puccini's last work within the tradition of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi. In a summary of the sounds, sights, and symbolism of Turandot, the authors touch on earlier treatments of the subject, outline the conception, birth, and reception of the work, and analyze its coordinated dramatic and musical design. Showing how the evolution of the libretto documents Puccini's reversion to large musical forms typical of the Great Tradition in the late nineteenth century, they give particular attention to his use of contrasting Romantic, modernist, and two kinds of orientalist coloration in the general musical structure. They suggest that Puccini's inability to complete the opera resulted mainly from inadequate dramatic buildup for Turandot's last-minute change of heart combined with an overly successful treatment of the secondary character.",3.43,0691091374,9780691091372,May 26th 1991 by Princeton University Press (first published March 1st 1991),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170381512l/51616.jpg
51617,End of Globalization: Lessons from the Great Depression,Harold James,"""Globalization"" is here. Signified by an increasingly close economic interconnection that has led to profound political and social change around the world, the process seems irreversible. In this book, however, Harold James provides a sobering historical perspective, exploring the circumstances in which the globally integrated world of an earlier era broke down under the pressure of unexpected events.James examines one of the great historical nightmares of the twentieth century: the collapse of globalism in the Great Depression. Analyzing this collapse in terms of three main components of global economics--capital flows, trade, and international migration--James argues that it was not simply a consequence of the strains of World War I but resulted from the interplay of resentments against all these elements of mobility, as well as from the policies and institutions designed to assuage the threats of globalism. Could it happen again? There are significant parallels today: highly integrated systems are inherently vulnerable to collapse, and world financial markets are vulnerable and unstable. While James does not foresee another Great Depression, his book provides a cautionary tale in which institutions meant to save the world from the consequences of globalization--think WTO and IMF, in our own time--ended by destroying both prosperity and peace.",3.96,0674010078,9780674010079,October 15th 2002 by Harvard University Press (first published 2001),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388195645l/51617.jpg

51623,The Brown Plague: Travels in Late Weimar and Early Nazi Germany,Daniel Gu√©rin,"In 1932 and 1933, during the months surrounding the Nazi seizure of power, Daniel Gu√©rin, then a young French journalist, made two trips through Germany. The Brown Plague, translated here into English for the first time, is Gu√©rin‚Äôs eyewitness account of the fall of the Weimar Republic and the first months of the Third Reich. Originally written for the popular French left press and then revised by the author into book form, The Brown Plague delivers a passionate warning to French workers about the terror and horror of fascism. Gu√©rin chronicles the collapse of the German workers‚Äô movement and reports on the beginnings of clandestine resistance to the Nazis. He also describes the Socialist and Communist leaderships‚Äô inability to recognize the danger that led to their demise. Through vivid dialogs, interviews, and revealing descriptions of everyday life among the German people, he offers insight into the tragedy that was beginning to unfold. Gu√©rin‚Äôs travels took him across the countryside and into the cities of Germany. He describes with extraordinary clarity, for example, his encounters with large groups of unemployed workers in Berlin and the spectacle of Goering presiding over the Reichstag. Staying in youth hostels, Gu√©rin met individuals representing a range of various groups and movements, including the Wanderv√∂gel, leftist brigades, Hitler Youth, and the strange, semicriminal sexual underground of the Wild-frei. Devoting particular attention to the cultural politics of fascism and the lure of Nazism for Germany‚Äôs disaffected youth, he describes the seductive rituals by which the Nazis were able to win over much of the population. As Robert Schwartzwald makes clear in his introduction, Gu√©rin‚Äôs interest in Germany at this time was driven, in part, by a homoerotic component that could not be stated explicitly in his published material. This excellent companion essay also places The Brown Plague within a broad historical and literary context while drawing connections between fascism, aesthetics, and sexuality. Informed by an epic view of class struggle and an admiration for German culture, The Brown Plague, a notable primary source in the literature of modern Europe, provides a unique view onto the rise of Nazism.",4.16,0822314630,9780822314639,July 29th 1994 by Duke University Press Books (first published 1933),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348225634l/51623.jpg

But while well intentioned, many of these reports about child labor and sweatshop practices rely on stereotypes of how Third World factories operate, ignoring the complex economic dynamics driving the global apparel industry.To dispel these misunderstandings, Jane L. Collins visited two very different apparel firms and their factories in the United States and Mexico. Moving from corporate headquarters to factory floors, her study traces the diverse ties that link First and Third World workers and managers, producers and consumers. Collins examines how the transnational economics of the apparel industry allow firms to relocate or subcontract their work anywhere in the world, making it much harder for garment workers in the United States or any other country to demand fair pay and humane working conditions.Putting a human face on globalization, Threads shows not only how international trade affects local communities but also how workers can organize in this new environment to more effectively demand better treatment from their distant corporate employers.",3.20,0226113728,9780226113722,September 3rd 2003 by University of Chicago Press (first published 2003),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388708002l/51643.jpg
51644,Why Read Marx Today?,Jonathan Wolff,"The fall of the Berlin Wall had enormous symbolic resonance, marking the collapse of Marxist politics and economics. Indeed, Marxist regimes have failed miserably, and with them, it seems, all reason to take the writings of Karl Marx seriously. Jonathan Wolff argues that if we detach Marx the critic of current society from Marx the prophet of some never-to-be-realized worker's paradise, he remains the most impressive critic we have of liberal, capitalist, bourgeois society. The author shows how Marx's main ideas still shed light onwider concerns about culture and society and he guides the reader through Marx's notoriously difficult writings. Wolff also argues that the value of a great thinker does not depend on his or her views being true, but on other features such as originality, insight, and systematic vision. From thisperspective, Marx still richly deserves to be read. Why Read Marx Today? reinstates Marx as an important critic of current society, and not just a figure of historical interest.",3.76,0192805053,9780192805058,"October 30th 2003 by Oxford University Press, USA (first published 2002)",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388224611l/51644.jpg

Anthropologists, terrified of being accused of romanticism, respond with silence . . . .

51646,The Great Compassion: Buddhism and Animal Rights,Norm Phelps,"Buddhism ought to be an animal rights religion par excellence. It has long held that all life forms are sacred and considers kindness and compassion the highest virtues. Moreover, Buddhism explicitly includes animals in its moral universe. Buddhist rules of conduct‚Äîincluding the first precept, ‚ÄúDo not kill‚Äù‚Äîapply to our treatment of animals as well as to our treatment of other human beings. Consequently, we would expect Buddhism to oppose all forms of animal exploitation, and there is, in fact, wide agreement that most forms of animal exploitation are contrary to Buddhist teaching. Yet many Buddhists eat meat‚Äîalthough many do not‚Äîand monks, priests, and scholars sometimes defend meat-eating as consistent with Buddhist teaching. The Great Compassion studies the various strains of Buddhism and the sutras that command respect for all life. Norm Phelps, a longtime student of Buddhism and an acquaintance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, answers the central questions of whether Buddhism demands vegetarianism and whether the Buddha ate meat. He is not afraid to examine anti-animal statements in Buddhist lore‚Äîparticularly the issues of whether Buddhists in non-historically Buddhist countries need to keep or to jettison the practices of their historical homelands.",4.23,1590560698,9781590560693,June 1st 2004 by Lantern Publishing Media,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386912119l/51646.jpg

51654,DMT: The Spirit Molecule,Rick Strassman,"A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death & Mystical Experiences.A clinical psychiatrist explores the effects of DMT: A behind-the-scenes look at the cutting edge of psychedelic research.From 1990 to 1995 Dr. Rick Strassman conducted US DEA-approved clinical research at the University of New Mexico in which he injected 60 volunteers with DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. His detailed account of those sessions is an inquiry into the nature of the human mind and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. DMT, a plant-derived chemical that is also manufactured by the human brain, consistently produced near-death and mystical experiences. Many volunteers reported convincing encounters with intelligent nonhuman presences, especially ""aliens."" Nearly all felt that the sessions were among the most profound experiences of their lives.Strassman's research connects DMT with the pineal gland, considered by Hindus to be the site of the seventh chakra and by Ren√© Descartes to be the seat of the soul. DMT: The Spirit Molecule makes the case that DMT, naturally released by the pineal gland, facilitates the soul's movement in and out of the body and is an integral part of the birth and death experiences, as well as the highest states of meditation and even sexual transcendence. Strassman also believes that alien abduction experiences are brought on by accidental releases of DMT. If used wisely, DMT could trigger a period of remarkable progress in the scientific exploration of the most mystical regions of the human mind and soul.",4.10,0892819278,9780892819270,December 1st 2000 by Park Street Press,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1298999411l/51654.jpg

Viewing them as feminist and postfeminist writers, Kafka argues that gender asymmetry in all its varied forms and guises is the major issue that they confront. Satirizing this world-wide oppression as the missionary position, Kafka urges ethnic and women of color feminist critics to focus more on commonalities rather than view differences as impenetrable barriers.",4.00,0313301611,9780313301612,June 11th 1997 by Praeger,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347586175l/51656.jpg

A riveting, cautionary tale with disastrous results reveals the chilling answer.Hoping to create a new growth agent for food with beneficial uses to mankind, two scientists find that the spread of the material is uncontrollable. Giant chickens, rats, and insects run amok, and children given the food stuffs experience incredible growth--and serious illnesses. Over the years, people who have eaten these specially treated foods find themselves unable to fit into a society where ignorance and hypocrisy rule. These ""giants,"" with their extraordinary mental powers, find themselves shut away from an older, more traditional society. Intolerance and hatred increase as the line of distinction between ordinary people and giants is drawn across communities and families. One of H. G.

51676,"You Can't Get Much Closer Than This: Combat with Company H, 317th Infantry Regiment, 80th Division",Andrew Z. Adkins,"Andrew Z. Adkins, Jr., graduated from The Citadel in May 1943 and immediately attended the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School, where he was commissioned and sent on to the 80th Infantry Division, then undergoing its final training cycle in the California-Arizona desert. Upon reaching the division, 2d Lieutenant Adkins was assigned as an 81mm mortar section leader in Company H, 2d Battalion, 317th Infantry Regiment.When the 80th Infantry Division completed its training in December 1943, it was shipped in stages to the United Kingdom and then on to Normandy, where it landed on August 3, 1944. There, Lieutenant Adkins and his fellow soldiers took part in light hedgerow fighting that served to shake the division down and familiarize the troops and their officers with combat.The first real test came on August 20, 1944, when the 2d Battalion, 317th Infantry, attacked high ground near Argentan during the Allied drive to seal huge German forces in the Falaise Pocket. While scouting for mortar positions in the woods, Andy Adkins ran into a group of Germans and shot one of them dead with his carbine. This baptism in blood taught him the answer to a question every novice combatant wants to hear: He was cool under fire, capable of killing when facing the enemy. He later wrote, ""It was a sickening sight, but having been caught up in the heat of battle, I didn't have a reaction other than feeling I had saved my own life.""Thereafter, the 2d Battalion, 317th Infantry, took part in a succession of bloody battles across France. Ineptly led through the tentures of several battalion commanders, the unit suffered grievous losses even as it took hills and towns away from brave and well-led German veterans. In the course of fighting graphically portrayed in this soldier's memoir, Andy Adkins acted with remarkable skill and courage, placing himself at the forefront of the action whenever he could. His extremely aggressive delivery of critical supplies to a cutoff unit in an embattled French town earned him a Bronze Star Medal, the first such award in his battalion.You Can't Get Much Closer Than This is at heart a young soldier's story of war. In vibrant, piercing terms, a junior officer's coming of age in battle is the compelling focus of page after page of action sequences that add up to a solid description of what modern warfare is really all about. Before his death in 19--, Andy Adkins was able to face his memory of war as bravely as he faced the war itself. He set it all down on paper, honest, unflinching, and straightforward. In 1944 and 1945, young Lieutenant Adkins did his duty to his men and his country, and much later he did his duty to his readers. Indeed, you really can't get much closer than this.",4.03,1932033289,9781932033281,October 19th 2005 by Casemate Publishers and Book Distributors (first published June 1st 2005),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347940329l/51676.jpg

The Words of My Perfect Teacher is the classic commentary on the preliminary practices of the Longchen Nyingtig - one of the best-known cycles of teaching and a spiritual treasure of the Nyingmapa school - the oldest Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Patrul Rinpoche makes the technicalities of his subject accessible through a wealth of stories, quotations, and references to everyday life.

51696,Anarchism and Other Essays,Emma Goldman,"In the eighteen-nineties and for years thereafter, America reverberated with the name of the ""notorious Anarchist,"" feminist, revolutionist and agitator, Emma Goldman. A Russian Jewish immigrant at the age of 17, she moved by her own efforts from seamstress in a clothing factory to internationally known radical lecturer, writer, editor and friend of the oppressed. This book is a collection of her remarkably penetrating essays, far in advance of their time, originally published by the Mother Earth press which she founded.In the first of these essays, Anarchism: What It Really Stands For, she says, ""Direct action, having proven effective along economic lines, is equally potent in the environment of the individual."" In Minorities Versus Majorities she holds that social and economic well-being will result only through ""the non-compromising determination of intelligent minorities, and not through the mass."" Other pieces deal with The Hypocrisy of Puritanism; Prisons: A Social Crim and Failure; The Psychology of Political Violence‚Äînote the relevence of these themes to our own time; The Drama: A Powerful Disseminator of Radical Thought; Patriotism: A Menace to Liberty; and The Tragedy of Woman's Emancipation. A biographical sketch by Hippolyte Havel precedes the essays.Anarchism and Other Essays provides a fascinating look into revolutionary issues at the turn of the century, a prophetic view of the social and economic future, much of which we have seen take place, and above all, a glimpse into the mind of an extraordinary woman: brilliant, provocative, dedicated, passionate, and what used to be called ""high-minded.""Unabridged republication of the 3rd (1917) edition, with a new Introduction by Richard Drinnon.

51697,The World's Most Dangerous Woman: A New Biography of Emma Goldman,Theresa Moritz,"Until now, biographies of the feminist and anarchist Emma Goldman (1869-1940) have paid scant attention to her three periods of residence in Canada (1926-28, 1933-35 and 1939-40), even though these were some of her most productive years as an activist, speaker and organizer. In the United States, Goldman was notorious as ""Red Emma"" and ""the most dangerous woman in America"" because of her advanced anti-authoritarian views. In fact, she was ""the world's most dangerous woman"" in the sense that she immersed herself in local issues wherever she was exiled, and was accepted as a public personality to a degree that would seem astounding in today's mainstream press. In researching this new biography of Emma Goldman, Theresa Moritz and Albert Moritz have scoured previously ignored private papers in Europe and the United States, and a wealth of indigenous resources long unknown to, or undervalued by, anarchists and feminists. The result is virtually a fresh interpretation of Goldman's influential and troubled life, and a valuable piece of social history as well.",4.00,0968166075,9780968166079,January 22nd 2001 by Subway Books,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170382053l/51697._SY475_.jpg

She was a fiery advocate, taking bold stands on a wide range of issues including women‚Äôs rights, homosexuality, capitalism, and the military draft. Her tumultuous childhood in Tsarist Russia fostered her rebelliousness and emboldened her opposition to violent authority. Upon arriving in New York in 1885, Goldman found a home in the anarchist movement in the United States. She traveled the country to deliver lectures on anarchism, and was jailed for urging unemployed workers to demand the food they needed. Goldman also aggressively supported Margaret Sanger‚Äôs effort to educate women about birth control. Goldman was deported to Russia as fears of an anarchist revolution in the US grew. But back in her homeland, she didn‚Äôt find the socialist paradise of worker equality and empowerment she had hoped would take root after the Bolshevik Revolution.

This definitive multivolume work, which differs significantly from Goldman's autobiography, presents original texts‚Äîa significant group of which are published or translated into English for the first time‚Äîanchored by rigorous contextual annotations. The distillation of years of scholarly research, these volumes include personal correspondence, newspaper articles, government surveillance reports from America and Europe, dramatic court transcripts, lecture notes, and previously unpublished documents retrieved from obscurity. Biographical, newspaper, and organizational appendices are complemented by in-depth chronologies that underscore the complexity of Goldman's political and social milieu.Making Speech Free, 1902‚Äì1909, the second volume in the series, chronicles Goldman's pivotal role in the early battle for free expression. It highlights the relationship between the development of the right of free speech and turn-of-the-century anarchist ideas. The enactment of anti-anarchist laws and the organization of groups in protest occupy center stage among the primary documents. Within this frame, the volume presents Goldman's evolving attitudes toward violence in both its European and American contexts, the emergent revolution in Russia, and the beginnings of the Modern School education movement in America, the social significance of European modern drama, and the right of labor to organize against unfair working conditions in the United States. The volume features the early evolution of Goldman's magazine, Mother Earth, launched in 1906, which promoted a blending of modern literary and cultural ideas into her radical and social political agenda and became a platform for the articulation of her feminist critique, an expression of her international reach, and a marker of her desire to spread anarchist ideas outside the immigrant left. Making Speech Free also tracks Goldman's emergence as a writer and orator whose scathing critique of hypocrisy in all realms of life and politics would eventually capture the attention and imagination of America.",4.33,0520225694,9780520225695,November 22nd 2004 by University of California Press (first published October 23rd 2004),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348386861l/51706.jpg

They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting--sad, afraid, angry, and silent. Kindlon and Thompson set out to answer this basic, crucial question: What do boys need that they're not getting? They illuminate the forces that threaten our boys, teaching them to believe that ""cool"" equals macho strength and stoicism. Cutting through outdated theories of ""mother blame,"" ""boy biology,"" and ""testosterone,"" the authors shed light on the destructive emotional training our boys receive--the emotional miseducation of boys.Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that emotional literacy is the most valuable gift we can offer our sons, urging parents to recognize the price boys pay when we hold them to an impossible standard of manhood. They identify the social and emotional challenges that boys encounter in school and show how parents can help boys cultivate emotional awareness and empathy--giving them the vital connections and support they need to navigate the social pressures of youth.",3.98,0345434854,9780345434852,April 4th 2000 by Ballantine Books (first published April 4th 1999),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431663431l/51723._SY475_.jpg
51725,Bad Boy: The Life And Politics Of Lee Atwater,John Joseph Brady,"Lee Atwater revolutionized presidential campaigning. He helped to create a solid Republican south. And he became notorious for turning national politics back into a blood sport, not only using nasty attacks but reveling in his image as the bad boy of Washington. Then, at the age of 39, Atwater was struck by a brain tumor. In thirteen months, cancer ended the most controversial career in modern politics‚Äîthe charismatic, colorful, and contradictory life of Lee Atwater.Even today Atwater is a fallen leader Republicans love and a rival Democrats love to hate. He was the first political handler as mediagenic as his candidates‚Äîcertainly the first chairman of the Republican National Committee to record a blues album. His campaigns represent the high-water mark of the GOPs postwar dominance of the presidency, and his techniques set the tone for races across the country. Watching Washington since his death, politicians and pundits still wonder, What if Lee Atwater had lived?  Bad Boy reveals how Lee Atwater began his career controlling crowds as jittery class clown, traumatized by the agonizing death of his little brother. In college he discovered the subtle intercourse of policy and public opinion and grew from party animal to party man. Bad Boy  details Atwater's political strategies from the grass roots to the national level. Even more ruthless were the behind-the-scenes power games as he crossed paths, and occasionally crossed swords, with nearly every major Republican of the 1980s: Reagan, Bush, Baker, Ailes, Rollins, and many more.In Bad Boy, we also see the faces Atwater tried to spin away. He was a compulsive womanizer, climbing through windows to avoid reporters. He played radical politics but promoted ‚Äùbig tent‚Äù Republicanism. Even his last public moment is controversial. Did Atwater's deathbed words really repudiate entire campaigns, or were they twisted by political enemies and second-hand reporting? Was his repentance sincere or simply one last gasp of press manipulation? Was he responsible for the infamous Willie Horton ads, or was he unfairly blamed by 1988s losers, trying for a moral victory? Is Lee Atwater, a master of spin, now being spun in his grave?In its sudden end, Atwater's remarkable life resembled the rise and fall of a fine political novel. With the probing insights of an expert interviewer and a rare stylistic verve, John Brady tells that whole frantic, fascinating story‚Äîthe life of the baddest boy in D.C.",4.28,0201627337,9780201627336,December 30th 1996 by Da Capo Press (first published 1996),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387711359l/51725.jpg

51760,The Minnesota Stories of Sinclair Lewis,Sinclair Lewis,"Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, applied subversive satire and razor wit in his portrayals of American life. Born and raised in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, he was one of the earliest writers to attack the myth of the noble, happy, American small town. Main Street, which he described as his ""first novel to rouse the embattled peasantry,"" was praised and reviled--and immensely popular. This initial success was followed by such accomplished books as Babbitt, Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, and Dodsworth, classics that today hold a prominent place in the American canon. Among the best of Lewis's works were short stories that he wrote for the popular magazines of the day. The Minnesota Stories of Sinclair Lewis collects the finest of these stories, acerbic tales set in Minnesota that reflect his favorite themes: local boosterism, the plight of strong women, native fascism, the grip of materialism. Lewis inserts himself as a character in two tales: he travels to Main Street's Gopher Prairie, where he talks to Dr. Will Kennicott, and to Babbitt's Zenith, where George Babbitt gives him a piece of his mind. Two of these stories have never been published, and six have not been reprinted since they first appeared.

Various social, political, and historical factors have conspired to leave us in a veritable crisis: the decline of hospitality.Why is this a crisis? Why should we practice hospitality? What is it about Christian theology that compels us to think about hospitality in the first place? Sutherland offers a passionate plea to recover and rediscover hospitality, and to respond to the divine appeal to welcome the stranger.Therein lies the central concern of the book: that hospitality is not simply the practice of a virtue but is integral to the very nature of Christianity's position toward God, self, and the world--it is at the very center of what it means to be a Christian and to think theologically. He offers a challenging definition of hospitality and calls us to a practice that is the virtue by which the church stands or falls.Drawing on modern theologians (including Howard Thurman, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Karl Barth, Martin Luther King Jr., and Letty Russell) and considering American slavery, the Holocaust, feminism, and prisons, Sutherland eloquently presents a Christian theology of hospitality.",3.61,,,November 1st 2006 by Abingdon Press,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421714080l/51778.jpg

Exploring the intact and beautiful Greek amphitheaters at Siracusa and Taormina, the cathedral at Monreale, the Roman mosaics at Piazza Armerina, and some of the masterpieces of the Baroque scattered throughout the island, Prose focuses her keen insight to imagine them in their own time, to examine the evolution and decline of the cultures that produced them, and to deconstruct powerful responses each evokes in her.Illuminated by the author's own photographs,¬†Sicilian Odyssey¬†brings exotic and enigmatic Sicily to life through the prism of its past.",3.34,0792265351,9780792265351,March 1st 2003 by National Geographic,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320443041l/51791.jpg

51810,When the Dogs Ate Candles: A Time in El Salvador,Bill Hutchinson,"When the Dogs Ate Candles follows one U.S. citizen as he journeys into the terrible reality of El Salvador in the 1980s, a reality that made the term ""death squad"" common in the English-speaking world. Galvanized by what he learned in a chance encounter in 1986, the author, Bill Hutchinson, undertook a novel strategy to protect human rights workers in El Salvador. Called ""the Accompaniment Project"", the plan brought U.S. volunteers to El Salvador to remain by the side of Salvadorans involved in human rights work. Hutchinson's gamble was that murderers, fearing an outcry in the U.S., would hesitate to kill anyone accompanied by a U.S. citizen.This is also the story of Salvadorans who stood up to a barbaric regime: the savage torture of Mirtala Lopez, a teenaged leader of a refugee organization who survived to continue her work among the displaced; the brilliant human rights work of Herbert Anaya, leader of the Non-Governmental Human Rights Commission of El Salvador, who was assassinated in 1987; and the astonishing testimony of an embittered army defector, Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez, who escaped to the U.S. to tell that his unit operated as a clandestine death squad unit using funds provided by U.S. supervisors. U.S. citizens are also here: Brian Willson, the Vietnam veteran who lost his legs when he sat in front of a munitions train; Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) who carried photographic evidence of the war's savagery to the floor of the House.When the Dogs Ate Candles affords an intimate insight into a handful of people -- ordinary people made extraordinary by the circumstances they faced -- and unfolds a compelling narrative of a terrible episode in human history.

51845,Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s,Kathleen M. Blee,"Ignorant. Brutal. Male. One of these stereotypes of the Ku Klux Klan offer a misleading picture. In Women of the Klan, sociologist Kathleen Blee unveils an accurate portrait of a racist movement that appealed to ordinary people throughout the country. In so doing, she dismantles the popular notion that politically involved women are always inspired by pacifism, equality, and justice.""All the better people,"" a former Klanswoman assures us, were in the Klan. During the 1920s, perhaps half a million white native-born Protestant women joined the Women's Ku Klux Klan (WKKK). Like their male counterparts, Klanswomen held reactionary views on race, nationality, and religion. But their perspectives on gender roles were often progressive. The Klan publicly asserted that a women's order could safeguard women's suffrage and expand their other legal rights. Privately the WKKK was working to preserve white Protestant supremacy.Blee draws from extensive archival research and interviews with former Klan members and victims to underscore the complexity of extremist right-wing political movements. Issues of women's rights, she argues, do not fit comfortably into the standard dichotomies of ""progressive"" and ""reactionary."" These need to be replaced by a more complete understanding of how gender politics are related to the politics of race, religion, and class.",3.88,0520078764,9780520078765,July 16th 1992 by University of California Press,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170383179l/51845.jpg

Colorado was one of the Klan's strongest enclaves, and Downing perfectly captures the subtle, clandestine terror inspired by its tactics of intimidation and violence as well as the power of the fear felt by the people it menaced. Downing creates in Liz O'Brien an adroit and tenacious sleuth who, with the help of her family's former maid Greta Kuhlmann and airmail pilot Frank Capillupo, unravels a treacherous plot to undermine freedom and cover up bootlegging, blackmail, and murder.

And no one is in a better position to write it than Kelly Belanger and Linda Strom. Instructors of college-credit writing courses at a steelworkers' union hall, these authors traveled throughout the country researching successful union-based and corporate-identified writing programs. Their goal was to discover sound pedagogies that accommodate the special needs and strengths of working adults.Second Shift is the first study to combine historical and contemporary perspectives on pedagogical and political issues that affect college-level literacy education for working students. Through case studies of five current writing programs, this book details how four approaches to teaching critical literacy shape teachers' classroom practice-from selection of readings, to writing assignments, to course goals. By combining theory and practice, the authors give specific and useful ideas for:developing writing curriculums customized for working adultsoffering college-credit for writing about life experiencescreating flexible delivery modesreflecting on ideology in the writing classroomteaching writing to adults across disciplinesworking in partnership with unions and corporations.Second Shift is an invaluable resource for college composition instructors, theorists, and administrators as they face the challenge of teaching writing in today's educational landscape.",4.50,0867094494,9780867094497,March 19th 1999 by Heinemann Educational Books,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170383205l/51850.jpg

What would a system of instruction look like if we took seriously the goal of helping all students understand mathematics?In this ground-breaking book, James Hiebert and his colleagues arm teachers with the best current research-based ideas for designingand defendingclassrooms that support students' mathematical understanding. It is based on the authors' work in four separate research programs, all of which investigated the effects of specific instructional approaches. Out of their ongoing discussions emerged a striking consensus about what features are essential and what features are optional, which they share in this book. They also provide glimpses into their individual projects and into the classrooms from which they have drawn many of their ideas.By describing the essential features of classrooms that support students' mathematical understanding and by offering pictures of several classrooms that exhibit these features, Making Sense provides a valuable framework within which elementary teachers can reflect on their own practice and think again about what it means to teach for understanding.",3.95,0435071327,9780435071325,April 21st 1997 by Heinemann Educational Books,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347516491l/51853.jpg

51862,God and the Philosophers: The Reconciliation of Faith and Reason,Thomas V. Morris,"I am a philosopher because I am a Christian, writes Brian Leftow. To many intellectuals, this probably sounds like saying that I am a dog because I am a cat. Indeed, prejudice against religious belief runs deep in the academy; in particular, many philosophers hold that faith is incompatible with their profession. But Thomas Morris has met that view head-on by asking a distinguished group of philosophers to write about the union of faith and reason in their lives. God and the Philosophers offers a series of highly personal, thoughtful essays by traditionally religious philosophers, revealing the power of belief in their intellectually rigorous lives and work. Figures such as William P. Alston, William J. Wainwright, Marilyn McCord Adams, Peter van Inwagen, and Morris himself, to name a few, speak of their own spiritual journeys, sharing their experiences as philosophically reflective individuals seeking to center themselves on God. We read of conversions from unbelief, struggles with doubts raised by the presence of evil in the world, and changing convictions shaped by constant questioning and communing with God. For example, Brian Leftow describes his acceptance of Christianity, after being raised in a secular Jewish home, and Laura Garcia writes about her conversion to Catholicism from her earlier Protestant stance. Along the way, the writers reveal religious philosophy at work--demonstrating, as Arthur F. Holmes writes, the motivation to intellectual inquiry that Christian faith brings. Here we see how individuals with extraordinary intellectual training, discipline, and knowledge grapple with personal and existential problems, drawing on their faith as well as their finely honed reason to achieve new understanding. Profoundly honest and deeply thoughtful, these essays reveal how highly educated philosophers--working in the halls of dispassionate analysis--come to grips with their faith in a skeptical world. Together, they make a profound statement on contemporary spirituality, and the quandaries facing today's religious individual.",3.68,0195101197,9780195101195,"January 11th 1996 by Oxford University Press, USA (first published November 10th 1994)",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386922125l/51862.jpg

How can a being or person who is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, etc., have become human given that humans are limited in knowledge and beset with weaknesses? Unless this belief in the incarnation is to be dismissed as pious sentimentality, a philosophical case must be made for at least the possible rationality of the idea. Tom Morris makes such an attempt in this book. Indeed, although it claims only to be arguing that the idea of God Incarnate is not impossible, The Logic of God Incarnate confronts the preponderance of modem philosophical argumentation against the incarnation and manages to put the traditional doctrine in a quite plausible light.",4.32,1579106293,9781579106294,April 6th 2001 by Wipf & Stock Publishers (first published March 1st 1986),https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389824465l/51870.jpg

51892,Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House: The Illustrated Story of an Architectural Masterpiece,Donald Hoffmann,"Frank Lloyd Wright firmly believed that ""life could be formed anew if new form could be brought to its setting, architecture."" His revolt against customary architectural design was shared by rugged individualist Fred C. Robie, who chose Wright to build his dream house in 1908 ‚Äî a structure that was eventually named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In this painstakingly researched and illuminating account of the design and construction of the Robie home, a noted architectural authority presents an in-depth study remarkable for clarity and thoroughness.At age 28, Robie had become a highly successful businessman who conceived the idea of building a grand home in his native Chicago. He insisted on a design incorporating features that were innovative for the day: hallways and stairwells situated to conserve valuable space, rooms that suggested feelings of airiness, and narrow trimmings on doorways and windows, among others. Robie's wish to shape space as a means of personal expression meshed with Wright's own feelings and spirit. The two strong-willed men formed a perfect union: Robie had found his architect and Wright his ideal client.Drawing on revealing family documents, including a 1958 interview with Robie, and a host of other sources, the author has compiled an authoritative photo-history, enabling the reader to witness each stage and various transformations of a landmark of modern architecture. The text is enhanced by 160 carefully selected illustrations, including perspectives and elevations, cross-sectional drawings, floor plans, designs for windows, carpets, lighting fixtures and other furnishings, plus recent and historic photographs. Now students, architects, any lover of fine buildings can watch an architectural masterpiece take shape in this profusely illustrated history of the house Wright himself labeled ""a source of world-wide architectural inspiration.""",3.88,0486245829,9780486245829,July 1st 1984 by Dover Publications,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328868764l/51892.jpg

In this essential book, which Nietzsche himself called his ""deepest,"" the philosopher uses ancient mythology and biblical parody to develop his concept of the ""superman,"" the ultimate human triumph over conformity, religion, morality, even civilization itself. Later corrupted out of all recognition by Nazi philosophy, this extraordinary work is, in fact, the basis for 20th-century existentialism and one of the finest examples of modern literature in any language. German psychologist and philosopher FRIEDRICH WILHELM NIETZSCHE (1844-1900) was appointed special professor of classical philology at the University of Basel at the precocious age of 24, but soon found himself dissatisfied with academic life and created an alternative intellectual society for himself among friends including composer Richard Wagner, historian Jakob Burckhardt, and theologian Franz Overbeck.
